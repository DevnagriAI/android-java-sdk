    <string name="rwh_ans7">At least 1 lac litre per annum can be harvested with 1000sq ft roof size with rain fall of 38 inch.</string>
    <string name="rwh_ans8">Yes it\'s almost maintenance free and durable system. Needed only annual cleaning by next door plumber</string>
    <string name="rwh_ans9">Our Service Delivery Partner will give all installation &amp; design related inputs with the final cost of installation in soft copy</string>

    <string name="rwh_ans12">Our service partner will collect the advance 60% before installation and rest 40% will be collected post installation and once system is Functional.</string>
    <string name="rwh_ans13">"Yes. There are provisions by local state government and Municipal Corporation to give waiver( 6% to 20%) in
Wealth Tax or House Tax for confirming RWH system installed with Certified by Party who installed."</string>
    <string name="rwh_ans14">Rain Water harvesting system installed by our service partner covers 1 year full warranty for any mechanical fault in the system.
With 1st year free AMC. ( post it will be chargeable agreed between both parties). Customers should safely store the warranty and AMC documents with them for any future needs.</string>
    <string name="rwh_ans15">Entire system can be used at full capacity for up to 20 years if Cleaning process done at advised intervals.</string>
    <string name="rwh_ans16">"There are generally 3 types of filters\n1)	Sand filter: These are constructed by brick masonry and filled by pebbles, gravel, and sand. Each layer is separated by wire mesh.\n2)	Charcoal filter: Charcoal filter can be made on site or in a drum. Pebbles, gravel and sand are filled in the drum or chamber. Each layer should be separated by wire mesh. Thin layer of charcoal is used to absorb odour if any.\n3)	PVC pipe filter: This filter is made of PVC pipe of 1 to 1.20 m length; Diameter of pipe depends on the area of roof. Six inches dia. pipe is enough for a 1500 Sq. Ft. roof and 8 inches dia. pipe should be used for roofs more than 1500 Sq. Ft. Pipe is divided into three compartments by wire mesh."</string>
    <string name="rwh_ans17">Yes certainly, RWH systems need not necessarily be installed in newly built houses, it can also be installed in houses which are already been built.</string>
    <string name="rwh_ans18">Existing unused structures like dried open wells, sumps etc can be used for RWH as also defunct borewells, instead of constructing recharge structures. This will also reduce the total cost.</string>
    <string name="rwh_ans19">"Underground and cellar tanks have to be fitted with an overflow through which the water can flow into the sewage system or an infiltration system.
If connected to the sewage system, the overflow should be above the system's backed-up water level. If necessary, a backpressure flap should be installed. Above-ground tanks should always be connected to a downpipe filter. This will prevent the water from flowing inward when the rainwater tank is full and instead it will flow through the downpipe into the sewer."</string>
    <string name="rwh_ans20">An underground tank is ideal for storing rainwater because the soil protects the tank from light and heat. Algae and microorganisms cannot form due to the darkness and temperature, ensuring consistent water quality. You should also ensure that an above-ground rainwater tank is as opaque  as possible (Not transparent or translucent or impenetrable to light). To avoid the water warming up too much, it should installed out of direct sunlight.</string>
    <string name="pc_quest1">What is termite (white ants) ?</string>
    <string name="pc_quest2">How will I know my premise is infested by termites ?</string>
    <string name="pc_quest3">What are the control measures or solutions for this ?</string>
    <string name="pc_quest4">How is this treatment done ?</string>
    <string name="pc_quest5">For the under construction buildings, is there any disturbance in the process of construction ?</string>
    <string name="pc_quest6"> For an existing building, is there any damage to the walls / structure</string>
    <string name="pc_quest7">I have to vacate the premises at the time of treatment ?</string>
    <string name="pc_quest8">Is there any warranty for this treatment ?</string>
    <string name="pc_quest9">How much does it cost ?</string>
    <string name="pc_ans1">Termites (sub terranean)  are social insects and live in colonies below ground. The worker termites enter our structure through a gap (0.5 mm gap is sufficient for them)  in search of food (cellulosic material). Material containing cellulose like wood (furniture) , paper &amp; cloth is attacked by them.</string>
    <string name="pc_ans2">Signs of termite infestation – a) Mud tube on wall, ceiling and furniture ; b) Damaged wooden furniture and fixtures ; c) scattered wings of alates / swammers ; d) Termite mound in the surrounding of the structure ; d) mud shelter on the trunk of the trees, dry patches of grass in lawn,  surrounding the structure</string>
    <string name="pc_ans3">The Principle of the treatment is " To create a continuous chemical barrier / zone in between the ground and the structure so the ground nesting termites will not attack the structure ".</string>
    <string name="pc_ans4">There are 2 said treatments. Pre construction anti termite treatment - This treatment is ideal for the underconstruction buildings in its early stages. In this the chemical barrier / zone is created in the soil at plinth level and this treatment is called "Pre-construction Anti-termite Treatment". And post construction anti termite treatment when the building structure is ready/existing  and infested with termites, this is done by drilling at the wall and floor junction / skirting level and creating the chemical barrier / zone at the bottom of the walls, this treatment is called "Post-construction Anti-termite Treatment".</string>

    <string name="pc_ans5">No. This is done simultaneously with your construction work before plinth PCC.</string>
    <string name="pc_ans6">No. The service provider will drill 12 mm dia holes @ 300 mm apart at skirting level. These holes will be sealed with white cement and we will try to match the colour of the wall to have minimum decor disturbance.</string>
    <string name="pc_ans7">No. You can also see the treatment done and the only precaution is to wear a face mask &amp; not to touch the chemically treated surfaces. The infants, aged persons or any allergic person should not be present at the time of treatment. And after the treatment you can stay immediately in the premises after cleaning.</string>
    <string name="pc_ans8">Yes. It varies from 1 to 10 years on the type of treatment, type of structure / building / premises, level of infestation etc. You can get more information from our service delivery partner after raising a service request.</string>
    <string name="pc_ans9">The charges will be decided after the inspection of the site and it depends on type of treatment, feasibility of treatment, internal furnitures &amp; fixtures, level of infestation, travel cost, time required for treatment etc.</string>

Post this, the Service request is passed on to our service delivery partner who will get in touch with you for the service delivery.</string>
    <string name="rwh_faq_q3">What will all will be covered in installation?</string>
    <string name="rwh_faq_a3">The water outlets from your rooftop would be connected together through PVC pipes which will further be connected to a filter. The filter\'s outlet would be connected to the borewell / Underground water tank (whichever provision you have in your plot for Rainwater Harvesting as a pre-requisite) </string>
    <string name="rwh_faq_q4">What is Rain Water Harvesting?</string>
    <string name="rwh_faq_a4">Rain Water Harvesting is the technique to store and conserve rain water for future use through installation of a filter system in a collection tank / borewell at home. The installation planning of Rain water harvesting system should ideally be done during house design stage. Utec offers this service to you, through our third party partners at a cost.</string>

    <string name="rwh_faq_q8">Is the Rain Water Harvesting system installation dependent on any existing or planned changes to the house?</string>
    <string name="rwh_faq_a8">1. If you are planning to store the rainwater for daily usage, then you need to have an underground concrete tank as collection point.\n2. The slope  of the rooftop and the water outlets direction should be towards borewell/Underground water tank so as to reduce the material requirement and hence costs during the final installation</string>
    <string name="rwh_faq_q9">Which is the preferred process for rainwater harvesting?</string>
    <string name="rwh_faq_a9">There are two types of processes for Rain Water Harvesting: Filter Process and Soak Pit System. Filter process is recommended for normal roof size(upto 3000 sqft). Soak pit system only for bigger Roof sizes(>3000 sqft) and industrial use</string>
    <string name="rwh_faq_q10">How much rainwater can I conserve from my roof area?</string>
    <string name="rwh_faq_a10">Approx 1 lac litre per annum can be harvested with 1000 sq ft roof size with rain fall of 38 inch(~96cm).</string>
    <string name="rwh_faq_q11">What kind of maintenance would the installed Rain Water Harvesting system require?</string>
    <string name="rwh_faq_a11">The installed system is nearly maintenance free and durable. It will need only annual cleaning by the local plumber.</string>

    <string name="rwh_faq_q14">Is there any government waiver or discount offering for Rain Water Harvesting system installation?</string>
    <string name="rwh_faq_a14">Yes. There are provisions by local state government and Municipal Corporation for a waiver (6% to 20%) in Property Tax or water bill (it applies in some places**)for confirming Rain Water Harvesting System installed with Certified by the installing Party/Vendor.</string>
    <string name="rwh_faq_q15">Is the Rain Water Harvesting system covered under any warranty by the service delivery partner?</string>
    <!--<string name="rwh_faq_a15">Rain Water harvesting system installed by our service partner is covered under 1 year full warranty for any mechanical fault in the system. The warranty comes with a free Annual Maintenance Contract (AMC) for the 1st year. After the first year, the AMC will be chargeable; to be agreed between you and the service delivery partner. You must safe-keep the warranty and AMC documents for future needs.</string> -->
    <string name="rwh_faq_a15">Rain Water harvesting system installed by our service partner covers 1 year full warranty for any mechanical fault in the system.

    <string name="rwh_faq_a16">Entire system can be used at full capacity for up to 20 years if cleaning process is done at advised intervals.</string>
    <string name="rwh_faq_q17">What are the different types of filters available?</string>
    <string name="rwh_faq_a17">There are generally 3 types of filters depending on area and water quality\n1)	Sand filter: These are constructed by brick masonry and filled by pebbles, gravel, and sand. Each layer is separated by wire mesh.\n2)	Charcoal filter: Charcoal filter can be made on site or in a drum. Pebbles, gravel and sand are filled in the drum or chamber. Each layer should be separated by wire mesh. Thin layer of charcoal is used to absorb odour if any.\n3)	PVC pipe filter: This filter is made of PVC pipe of 1 to 1.20 m length; Diameter of pipe depends on the area of roof. Six inches dia. pipe is enough for a 1500 Sq. Ft. roof and 8 inches dia. pipe should be used for roofs more than 1500 Sq. Ft. Pipe is divided into three compartments by wire mesh.</string>
    <string name="rwh_faq_q18">Is it possible to install a Rain Water Harvesting system in a constructed home?</string>
    <string name="rwh_faq_a18">Yes. Rain Water Harvesting systems need not necessarily be installed in newly built houses. They can also be installed in houses which are already been built.</string>
    <string name="rwh_faq_q19">Can existing storage structures/unused water sources be used for RWH?</string>
    <string name="rwh_faq_a19">Instead of constructing recharge structures, existing unused water sources like dried open wells, sumps, defunct borewells, etc can be used for Rain Water Harvesting.</string>
    <string name="rwh_faq_q20">What happens when the rainwater tank is full?</string>
    <string name="rwh_faq_a20">Underground and cellar tanks have to be fitted with an overflow through which the water can flow into the sewage system or an infiltration system. If connected to the sewage system, the overflow should be above the system\'s backed-up water level. If necessary, a backpressure flap should be installed. Above-ground tanks should always be connected to a downpipe filter. This will prevent the water from flowing inward when the rainwater tank is full and instead it will flow through the downpipe into the sewer.</string>
    <string name="rwh_faq_q21">Does the rainwater collected in the rainwater tank remains fresh?</string>
    <string name="rwh_faq_a21">An underground tank is ideal for storing rainwater because the soil protects the tank from light and heat. Algae and microorganisms cannot form due to exposure to sunlight and temperature, ensuring consistent water quality. If you have an above-ground rainwater tank, you must ensure that it is as opaque as possible (Not transparent or translucent) and it should installed away from direct sunlight, to prevent water from warming.</string>
    <string name="rwh_faq_q22">What is not covered in the rainwater harvesting service?</string>
    <string name="rwh_faq_a22">The installation of Underground water tank or borewell would not be done by the service provider under Rainwater Harvesting Service.</string>

    <string name="pc_faq_a3">The Pre-construction termite treatment done at foundation level comes with a warranty of 10 years. For the warranty to be valid, the treatment must be completely administered as per the process suggested by our Service Partner. You can get more information from our termite treatment delivery partner after raising a service request.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q4">What is termite (white ants, दीमक) ?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a4">Subterranean Termites are social insects and live in colonies below ground. They are considered pests because termites enter the house structure through a gap (0.5 mm gap is sufficient) in search of food. Food for termites is household material containing cellulose like wood, wooden furniture, paper and cloth.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q5">How do termites enter the house?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a5">Termites need moisture to survive and spread underground. They usually enter a house from the soil through its foundation or through cracks in the slab, expansion joints, voids in brick and around plumbing. Wood structures in direct contact with the ground are also easy access routes for termites.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q6">Can termites enter concrete?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a6">Termites cannot pass through solid concrete, but they can get through a crack only 1/32nd of an inch wide. Openings this size or bigger often occur where two pieces of concrete abut – like when poured separately – and around plumbing penetrations through the concrete or where the concrete has cracked.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q7">How they harm the house structure?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a7">Termites can hollow out the wood in the structure of your house. They can also damage the inside of the walls, areas around your windows and doors and the wood furniture inside your home.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q8">How to identify termite infestation?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a8">Signs of termite infestation –\na. Mud tube on wall, ceiling and furniture;\nb. Damaged wooden furniture and fixtures;\nc. Scattered wings of alates / swarmers;\nd. Termite mound in the surrounding of the structure;\ne. Mud shelter on the trunk of the trees, dry patches of grass in lawn, surrounding the structure</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q9">What is Pre-Construction Termite treatment?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a9">Pre-Construction termite treatment done to prevent termite infestation in new construction. As a part of the treatment, the layer of soil beneath a planned home is treated with termiticide to offer proactive protection. A pre-foundation termite treatment helps in ridding the soil of termites and creating a long term termite barrier for durability of the structure.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q10">Who can raise the termite treatment request?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a10">Home Builders &amp; Partners registered on Utec Platform can request and avail this service</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q11">Is this is a paid service?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a11">Termite Treatment is a paid service. Payment is to be made directly to our partner assigned for service delivery. No payment is to be done to Utec.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q12">What will the treatment at my site entail?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a12">Pre Construction: During the plinth level, the soil of the whole plinth level will be treated with the chemicals to create a chemical barrier for the termites.\nPost Construction: To provide the treatment, the service provider will drill 12 mm dia holes about 300 mm apart at skirting level. After the treatment, these holes will be sealed with white cement and we will try to match the colour of the wall to have minimum decor disturbance.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q13">How does the treatment work?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a13">The Principle of the treatment is "To create a continuous chemical barrier/zone between the ground and the structure so the ground nesting termites will not attack the structure".</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q14">How many types of termite control treatments are available?</string>
    <!--<string name="pc_faq_a14">There are 2 types of treatments.\na. Pre Construction Anti Termite Treatment - This treatment is ideal for the underconstruction buildings in its early stages. In this treatment, a chemical barrier / zone is created in the soil at plinth level.\nb. Post Construction Anti Termite Treatment - Post construction treatment is done in ready/existing buildings. When the ready structure is infested with termites, termites can be treated by drilling at the wall and floor junction or skirting level and creating the chemical barrier / zone at the bottom of the walls.</string>-->
    <string name="pc_faq_a14">There are 2 said treatments. Pre construction anti termite treatment - This treatment is ideal for the underconstruction buildings in its early stages. In this the chemical barrier / zone is created in the soil at plinth level and this treatment is called "Pre-construction Anti-termite Treatment". And post construction anti termite treatment when the building structure is ready/existing  and infested with termites, this is done by drilling at the wall and floor junction / skirting level and creating the chemical barrier / zone at the bottom of the walls, this treatment is called "Post-construction Anti-termite Treatment".</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q15">For the under construction buildings, does termite treatment cause any disturbance in the process of construction?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a15">The pre-termite foundation treatment is done simultaneously with your construction work before Plinth PCC (Plain Cement Concrete) and does not affect the process of construction.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q16">For an existing building, does termite treatment cause any damage to the structure?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a16">This treatments causes no damage to the structure. To provide the treatment, the service provider will drill 12 mm dia holes about 300 mm apart at skirting level. After the treatment, these holes will be sealed with white cement and we will try to match the colour of the wall to have minimum decor disturbance.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q17">Do the premises have to be vacated at the time of treatment for existing building (post construction treatment)?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a17">No. You can also see the treatment done. The only precaution is to wear a face mask &amp; to not touch the chemically treated surfaces. Infants, aged persons or any allergic person should not be present at the time of treatment. Post the treatment, you can stay in the premises immediately after cleaning.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q18">Is there any warranty for Post Construction termite treatment?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a18">For the post construction treatment, there is a warranty of 5 years, if done for the entire home / building. In case a specific floor of a building needs to be treated, a 1 year warranty would apply. For the warranty to be valid, the treatment must be completely administered as per the process suggested by our Service Partner. You can get more information from our termite treatment delivery partner after raising a service request.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q19">How much does termite treatment cost? </string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a19">Termite treatment charges can be quoted after the inspection of the site. Charges are dependent on the level of infestation, type of treatment, feasibility of treatment, internal furnitures &amp; fixtures, travel cost and time required for treatment. The service delivery partner will share a detailed estimate of cost post inspection.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q20">How much time does the treatment take?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a20">The treatment takes 1 day of time</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q21">Is the site visit paid or free?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a21">Site Inspection is free, but if the location is far away, then logistics costs may be charged which would get adjusted in the final invoice.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q22">What is covered in the termite treatment service?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a22">Sub-terranean termites (ground nesting termites) are only covered in the anti-termite treatment. Since these are the ground nesting termites which grow and travel through the soil, hence the treatment of creating a chemical barrier around the house stops these termites from infesting the house.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q23">What is not covered in the termite treatment service?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a23">Dry-wood termites infestation, which are usually experienced in the coastal regions are not covered under the treatment. Since, these termites are wood nesting termites, they grow inside the wood hence the chemical barrier at foundation level doesn\'t affect them.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q24">For Pre-Construction treatment, do I need to repeat the treatment after the warranty period?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a24">Once the treatment is done, if the created chemical barrier is disturbed somehow, then we need to re-do the treatment and it will charge extra to the customer. Otherwise, the treatment doesn\'t need to be re-done even after the warranty period is over.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q25">For post construction treatment, do I need to repeat the treatment after the warranty period?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a25">After the expiry of the warranty period, customer needs to re-do the post- construction Anti-termite treatment.</string>

You can also use the central east, west, north or south facing area to construct the drawing-room.\n\nSofa location: The best place to set the sofa is against the south and west walls. If there is no place on the south and west wall, go for the east side of the walls.\n\nTabletop foundations: A small, wall or tabletop fountain in the north direction made using copper, stone, glass, clay, stainless steel, or a fish aquarium will create a relaxing space and bring peace to the house along with amazing guests and healthy conversations.\n\nA.C. position: The best-suited wall for placing the air conditioner is on the west, as primarily they get heated up during the night.\n\nArt/ Picture position: Paintings on the north wall stimulate the positive aspect of water bodies and depict wealth. While hanging artwork on the east side brings fulfilment in life, thus painting of fruits and flowers is considered. </string>

    <string name="open_space_description_100">1Open space relative to the direction: Keep more open space around the building in the east and north directions than the west and the south directions.\n\nTulsi plant position: There should be a Tulsi Vrindavan in the east or northeast corner (A structure in which the holy basil plant is grown).

    <string name="verandah_description_100">1Ideal location: The ideal place for Verandah is in the North or East direction.\n\nHeight of roof and floor: According to Vaastu, a Verandah should be open. But, if there is a need for a roof, it should be constructed with cement, avoiding the use of tin.The floor and roof of the Verandah should always be lower than the floor and ceiling of the main building. A verandah usually is an open space and is prone to direct sunlight and heavy rains. Having a lower floor level and roof height makes it possible to maintain a cooler temperature.\n\nFlowerpot position: We usually place flower pots in our Verandah, and it has been advised to keep them in the North-East direction as we get a good supply of sunlight in this direction, essential for the sustenance of plants and flowers.\n\nA trap in the Verandah should be made for the sole purpose of draining run-off water. It should never be placed in the South-West side of the Verandah.\n\nShape of Verandah: The ideal shape of a Verandah is squares and rectangles.\n\nWater pools or fountains: It is advisable to build water pools or fountains in the Verandah.

It is advisable to have the main door in two parts instead of just one.\n\nNumber of risers in steps: Make sure that the number of risers in entrance steps is in odd numbers. Also, the main Entrance should be higher than the approach way or pathway.\n\nNameplate: Having a nameplate on the main door or on the compound wall of the house is believed to invite good health, prosperity, and wealth into the home.\n\nDoor material: Avoid metals for the door or even for the frame of the door. </string>

    <string name="rwh_ans13_100">1"Yes. There are provisions by local state government and Municipal Corporation to give waiver( 6% to 20%) in
Wealth Tax or House Tax for confirming RWH system installed with Certified by Party who installed."</string>
    <string name="rwh_ans14_100">1Rain Water harvesting system installed by our service partner covers 1 year full warranty for any mechanical fault in the system.

    <string name="rwh_ans16_100">1"There are generally 3 types of filters\n1)	Sand filter: These are constructed by brick masonry and filled by pebbles, gravel, and sand. Each layer is separated by wire mesh.\n2)	Charcoal filter: Charcoal filter can be made on site or in a drum. Pebbles, gravel and sand are filled in the drum or chamber. Each layer should be separated by wire mesh. Thin layer of charcoal is used to absorb odour if any.\n3)	PVC pipe filter: This filter is made of PVC pipe of 1 to 1.20 m length; Diameter of pipe depends on the area of roof. Six inches dia. pipe is enough for a 1500 Sq. Ft. roof and 8 inches dia. pipe should be used for roofs more than 1500 Sq. Ft. Pipe is divided into three compartments by wire mesh."</string>
    <string name="rwh_ans17_100">1Yes certainly, RWH systems need not necessarily be installed in newly built houses, it can also be installed in houses which are already been built.</string>
    <string name="rwh_ans18_100">1Existing unused structures like dried open wells, sumps etc can be used for RWH as also defunct borewells, instead of constructing recharge structures. This will also reduce the total cost.</string>
    <string name="rwh_ans19_100">1"Underground and cellar tanks have to be fitted with an overflow through which the water can flow into the sewage system or an infiltration system.
If connected to the sewage system, the overflow should be above the system's backed-up water level. If necessary, a backpressure flap should be installed. Above-ground tanks should always be connected to a downpipe filter. This will prevent the water from flowing inward when the rainwater tank is full and instead it will flow through the downpipe into the sewer."</string>
    <string name="rwh_ans20_100">1An underground tank is ideal for storing rainwater because the soil protects the tank from light and heat. Algae and microorganisms cannot form due to the darkness and temperature, ensuring consistent water quality. You should also ensure that an above-ground rainwater tank is as opaque  as possible (Not transparent or translucent or impenetrable to light). To avoid the water warming up too much, it should installed out of direct sunlight.</string>

    <string name="pc_quest8_100">1Is there any warranty for this treatment ?</string>
    <string name="pc_quest9_100">1How much does it cost ?</string>
    <string name="pc_ans1_100">1Termites (sub terranean)  are social insects and live in colonies below ground. The worker termites enter our structure through a gap (0.5 mm gap is sufficient for them)  in search of food (cellulosic material). Material containing cellulose like wood (furniture) , paper &amp; cloth is attacked by them.</string>
    <string name="pc_ans2_100">1Signs of termite infestation – a) Mud tube on wall, ceiling and furniture ; b) Damaged wooden furniture and fixtures ; c) scattered wings of alates / swammers ; d) Termite mound in the surrounding of the structure ; d) mud shelter on the trunk of the trees, dry patches of grass in lawn,  surrounding the structure</string>
    <string name="pc_ans3_100">1The Principle of the treatment is " To create a continuous chemical barrier / zone in between the ground and the structure so the ground nesting termites will not attack the structure ".</string>
    <string name="pc_ans4_100">1There are 2 said treatments. Pre construction anti termite treatment - This treatment is ideal for the underconstruction buildings in its early stages. In this the chemical barrier / zone is created in the soil at plinth level and this treatment is called "Pre-construction Anti-termite Treatment". And post construction anti termite treatment when the building structure is ready/existing  and infested with termites, this is done by drilling at the wall and floor junction / skirting level and creating the chemical barrier / zone at the bottom of the walls, this treatment is called "Post-construction Anti-termite Treatment".</string>

    <string name="pc_ans5_100">1No. This is done simultaneously with your construction work before plinth PCC.</string>
    <string name="pc_ans6_100">1No. The service provider will drill 12 mm dia holes @ 300 mm apart at skirting level. These holes will be sealed with white cement and we will try to match the colour of the wall to have minimum decor disturbance.</string>
    <string name="pc_ans7_100">1No. You can also see the treatment done and the only precaution is to wear a face mask &amp; not to touch the chemically treated surfaces. The infants, aged persons or any allergic person should not be present at the time of treatment. And after the treatment you can stay immediately in the premises after cleaning.</string>
    <string name="pc_ans8_100">1Yes. It varies from 1 to 10 years on the type of treatment, type of structure / building / premises, level of infestation etc. You can get more information from our service delivery partner after raising a service request.</string>
    <string name="pc_ans9_100">1The charges will be decided after the inspection of the site and it depends on type of treatment, feasibility of treatment, internal furnitures &amp; fixtures, level of infestation, travel cost, time required for treatment etc.</string>

The filter\'s outlet would be connected to the borewell / Underground water tank (whichever provision you have in your plot for Rainwater Harvesting as a pre-requisite) </string>
    <string name="rwh_faq_q4_100">1What is Rain Water Harvesting?</string>
    <string name="rwh_faq_a4_100">1Rain Water Harvesting is the technique to store and conserve rain water for future use through installation of a filter system in a collection tank / borewell at home. The installation planning of Rain water harvesting system should ideally be done during house design stage. Utec offers this service to you, through our third party partners at a cost.</string>

    <string name="rwh_faq_a8_100">11. If you are planning to store the rainwater for daily usage, then you need to have an underground concrete tank as collection point.\n2. The slope  of the rooftop and the water outlets direction should be towards borewell/Underground water tank so as to reduce the material requirement and hence costs during the final installation</string>
    <string name="rwh_faq_q9_100">1Which is the preferred process for rainwater harvesting?</string>
    <string name="rwh_faq_a9_100">1There are two types of processes for Rain Water Harvesting: Filter Process and Soak Pit System. Filter process is recommended for normal roof size(upto 3000 sqft). Soak pit system only for bigger Roof sizes(>3000 sqft) and industrial use</string>

    <string name="rwh_faq_q17_100">1What are the different types of filters available?</string>
    <string name="rwh_faq_a17_100">1There are generally 3 types of filters depending on area and water quality\n1)	Sand filter: These are constructed by brick masonry and filled by pebbles, gravel, and sand. Each layer is separated by wire mesh.\n2)	Charcoal filter: Charcoal filter can be made on site or in a drum. Pebbles, gravel and sand are filled in the drum or chamber. Each layer should be separated by wire mesh. Thin layer of charcoal is used to absorb odour if any.\n3)	PVC pipe filter: This filter is made of PVC pipe of 1 to 1.20 m length; Diameter of pipe depends on the area of roof. Six inches dia. pipe is enough for a 1500 Sq. Ft. roof and 8 inches dia. pipe should be used for roofs more than 1500 Sq. Ft. Pipe is divided into three compartments by wire mesh.</string>
    <string name="rwh_faq_q18_100">1Is it possible to install a Rain Water Harvesting system in a constructed home?</string>
    <string name="rwh_faq_a18_100">1Yes. Rain Water Harvesting systems need not necessarily be installed in newly built houses. They can also be installed in houses which are already been built.</string>
    <string name="rwh_faq_q19_100">1Can existing storage structures/unused water sources be used for RWH?</string>
    <string name="rwh_faq_a19_100">1Instead of constructing recharge structures, existing unused water sources like dried open wells, sumps, defunct borewells, etc can be used for Rain Water Harvesting.</string>
    <string name="rwh_faq_q20_100">1What happens when the rainwater tank is full?</string>
    <string name="rwh_faq_a20_100">1Underground and cellar tanks have to be fitted with an overflow through which the water can flow into the sewage system or an infiltration system. If connected to the sewage system, the overflow should be above the system\'s backed-up water level. If necessary, a backpressure flap should be installed. Above-ground tanks should always be connected to a downpipe filter. This will prevent the water from flowing inward when the rainwater tank is full and instead it will flow through the downpipe into the sewer.</string>
    <string name="rwh_faq_q21_100">1Does the rainwater collected in the rainwater tank remains fresh?</string>
    <string name="rwh_faq_a21_100">1An underground tank is ideal for storing rainwater because the soil protects the tank from light and heat. Algae and microorganisms cannot form due to exposure to sunlight and temperature, ensuring consistent water quality. If you have an above-ground rainwater tank, you must ensure that it is as opaque as possible (Not transparent or translucent) and it should installed away from direct sunlight, to prevent water from warming.</string>
    <string name="rwh_faq_q22_100">1What is not covered in the rainwater harvesting service?</string>

    <string name="pc_faq_q4_100">1What is termite (white ants, दीमक) ?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a4_100">1Subterranean Termites are social insects and live in colonies below ground. They are considered pests because termites enter the house structure through a gap (0.5 mm gap is sufficient) in search of food. Food for termites is household material containing cellulose like wood, wooden furniture, paper and cloth.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q5_100">1How do termites enter the house?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a5_100">1Termites need moisture to survive and spread underground. They usually enter a house from the soil through its foundation or through cracks in the slab, expansion joints, voids in brick and around plumbing. Wood structures in direct contact with the ground are also easy access routes for termites.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q6_100">1Can termites enter concrete?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a6_100">1Termites cannot pass through solid concrete, but they can get through a crack only 1/32nd of an inch wide. Openings this size or bigger often occur where two pieces of concrete abut – like when poured separately – and around plumbing penetrations through the concrete or where the concrete has cracked.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q7_100">1How they harm the house structure?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a7_100">1Termites can hollow out the wood in the structure of your house. They can also damage the inside of the walls, areas around your windows and doors and the wood furniture inside your home.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q8_100">1How to identify termite infestation?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a8_100">1Signs of termite infestation –\na. Mud tube on wall, ceiling and furniture;\nb. Damaged wooden furniture and fixtures;\nc. Scattered wings of alates / swarmers;\nd. Termite mound in the surrounding of the structure;\ne. Mud shelter on the trunk of the trees, dry patches of grass in lawn, surrounding the structure</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q9_100">1What is Pre-Construction Termite treatment?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a9_100">1Pre-Construction termite treatment done to prevent termite infestation in new construction. As a part of the treatment, the layer of soil beneath a planned home is treated with termiticide to offer proactive protection. A pre-foundation termite treatment helps in ridding the soil of termites and creating a long term termite barrier for durability of the structure.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q10_100">1Who can raise the termite treatment request?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a10_100">1Home Builders &amp; Partners registered on Utec Platform can request and avail this service</string>

    <string name="pc_faq_a12_100">1Pre Construction: During the plinth level, the soil of the whole plinth level will be treated with the chemicals to create a chemical barrier for the termites.\nPost Construction: To provide the treatment, the service provider will drill 12 mm dia holes about 300 mm apart at skirting level. After the treatment, these holes will be sealed with white cement and we will try to match the colour of the wall to have minimum decor disturbance.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q13_100">1How does the treatment work?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a13_100">1The Principle of the treatment is "To create a continuous chemical barrier/zone between the ground and the structure so the ground nesting termites will not attack the structure".</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q14_100">1How many types of termite control treatments are available?</string>
    <!--<string name="pc_faq_a14_100">1There are 2 types of treatments.\na. Pre Construction Anti Termite Treatment - This treatment is ideal for the underconstruction buildings in its early stages. In this treatment, a chemical barrier / zone is created in the soil at plinth level.\nb. Post Construction Anti Termite Treatment - Post construction treatment is done in ready/existing buildings. When the ready structure is infested with termites, termites can be treated by drilling at the wall and floor junction or skirting level and creating the chemical barrier / zone at the bottom of the walls.</string>-->
    <string name="pc_faq_a14_100">1There are 2 said treatments. Pre construction anti termite treatment - This treatment is ideal for the underconstruction buildings in its early stages. In this the chemical barrier / zone is created in the soil at plinth level and this treatment is called "Pre-construction Anti-termite Treatment".

    <string name="pc_faq_q15_100">1For the under construction buildings, does termite treatment cause any disturbance in the process of construction?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a15_100">1The pre-termite foundation treatment is done simultaneously with your construction work before Plinth PCC (Plain Cement Concrete) and does not affect the process of construction.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q16_100">1For an existing building, does termite treatment cause any damage to the structure?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a16_100">1This treatments causes no damage to the structure. To provide the treatment, the service provider will drill 12 mm dia holes about 300 mm apart at skirting level. After the treatment, these holes will be sealed with white cement and we will try to match the colour of the wall to have minimum decor disturbance.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q17_100">1Do the premises have to be vacated at the time of treatment for existing building (post construction treatment)?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a17_100">1No. You can also see the treatment done. The only precaution is to wear a face mask &amp; to not touch the chemically treated surfaces. Infants, aged persons or any allergic person should not be present at the time of treatment. Post the treatment, you can stay in the premises immediately after cleaning.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q18_100">1Is there any warranty for Post Construction termite treatment?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a18_100">1For the post construction treatment, there is a warranty of 5 years, if done for the entire home / building. In case a specific floor of a building needs to be treated, a 1 year warranty would apply. For the warranty to be valid, the treatment must be completely administered as per the process suggested by our Service Partner. You can get more information from our termite treatment delivery partner after raising a service request.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q19_100">1How much does termite treatment cost? </string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a19_100">1Termite treatment charges can be quoted after the inspection of the site. Charges are dependent on the level of infestation, type of treatment, feasibility of treatment, internal furnitures &amp; fixtures, travel cost and time required for treatment. The service delivery partner will share a detailed estimate of cost post inspection.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q20_100">1How much time does the treatment take?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a20_100">1The treatment takes 1 day of time</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q21_100">1Is the site visit paid or free?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a21_100">1Site Inspection is free, but if the location is far away, then logistics costs may be charged which would get adjusted in the final invoice.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q22_100">1What is covered in the termite treatment service?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a22_100">1Sub-terranean termites (ground nesting termites) are only covered in the anti-termite treatment. Since these are the ground nesting termites which grow and travel through the soil, hence the treatment of creating a chemical barrier around the house stops these termites from infesting the house.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q23_100">1What is not covered in the termite treatment service?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a23_100">1Dry-wood termites infestation, which are usually experienced in the coastal regions are not covered under the treatment. Since, these termites are wood nesting termites, they grow inside the wood hence the chemical barrier at foundation level doesn\'t affect them.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q24_100">1For Pre-Construction treatment, do I need to repeat the treatment after the warranty period?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a24_100">1Once the treatment is done, if the created chemical barrier is disturbed somehow, then we need to re-do the treatment and it will charge extra to the customer. Otherwise, the treatment doesn\'t need to be re-done even after the warranty period is over.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q25_100">1For post construction treatment, do I need to repeat the treatment after the warranty period?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a25_100">1After the expiry of the warranty period, customer needs to re-do the post- construction Anti-termite treatment.</string>

    <string name="rwh_ans16_200">2"There are generally 3 types of filters\n1)	Sand filter: These are constructed by brick masonry and filled by pebbles, gravel, and sand. Each layer is separated by wire mesh.\n2)	Charcoal filter: Charcoal filter can be made on site or in a drum. Pebbles, gravel and sand are filled in the drum or chamber. Each layer should be separated by wire mesh. Thin layer of charcoal is used to absorb odour if any.\n3)	PVC pipe filter: This filter is made of PVC pipe of 1 to 1.20 m length; Diameter of pipe depends on the area of roof. Six inches dia. pipe is enough for a 1500 Sq. Ft. roof and 8 inches dia. pipe should be used for roofs more than 1500 Sq. Ft. Pipe is divided into three compartments by wire mesh."</string>
    <string name="rwh_ans17_200">2Yes certainly, RWH systems need not necessarily be installed in newly built houses, it can also be installed in houses which are already been built.</string>
    <string name="rwh_ans18_200">2Existing unused structures like dried open wells, sumps etc can be used for RWH as also defunct borewells, instead of constructing recharge structures. This will also reduce the total cost.</string>
    <string name="rwh_ans19_200">2"Underground and cellar tanks have to be fitted with an overflow through which the water can flow into the sewage system or an infiltration system.
If connected to the sewage system, the overflow should be above the system's backed-up water level. If necessary, a backpressure flap should be installed. Above-ground tanks should always be connected to a downpipe filter. This will prevent the water from flowing inward when the rainwater tank is full and instead it will flow through the downpipe into the sewer."</string>
    <string name="rwh_ans20_200">2An underground tank is ideal for storing rainwater because the soil protects the tank from light and heat. Algae and microorganisms cannot form due to the darkness and temperature, ensuring consistent water quality. You should also ensure that an above-ground rainwater tank is as opaque  as possible (Not transparent or translucent or impenetrable to light). To avoid the water warming up too much, it should installed out of direct sunlight.</string>

    <string name="pc_quest8_200">2Is there any warranty for this treatment ?</string>
    <string name="pc_quest9_200">2How much does it cost ?</string>
    <string name="pc_ans1_200">2Termites (sub terranean)  are social insects and live in colonies below ground. The worker termites enter our structure through a gap (0.5 mm gap is sufficient for them)  in search of food (cellulosic material). Material containing cellulose like wood (furniture) , paper &amp; cloth is attacked by them.</string>
    <string name="pc_ans2_200">2Signs of termite infestation – a) Mud tube on wall, ceiling and furniture ; b) Damaged wooden furniture and fixtures ; c) scattered wings of alates / swammers ; d) Termite mound in the surrounding of the structure ; d) mud shelter on the trunk of the trees, dry patches of grass in lawn,  surrounding the structure</string>
    <string name="pc_ans3_200">2The Principle of the treatment is " To create a continuous chemical barrier / zone in between the ground and the structure so the ground nesting termites will not attack the structure ".</string>
    <string name="pc_ans4_200">2There are 2 said treatments. Pre construction anti termite treatment - This treatment is ideal for the underconstruction buildings in its early stages. In this the chemical barrier / zone is created in the soil at plinth level and this treatment is called "Pre-construction Anti-termite Treatment". And post construction anti termite treatment when the building structure is ready/existing  and infested with termites, this is done by drilling at the wall and floor junction / skirting level and creating the chemical barrier / zone at the bottom of the walls, this treatment is called "Post-construction Anti-termite Treatment".</string>

    <string name="pc_ans5_200">2No. This is done simultaneously with your construction work before plinth PCC.</string>
    <string name="pc_ans6_200">2No. The service provider will drill 12 mm dia holes @ 300 mm apart at skirting level. These holes will be sealed with white cement and we will try to match the colour of the wall to have minimum decor disturbance.</string>
    <string name="pc_ans7_200">2No. You can also see the treatment done and the only precaution is to wear a face mask &amp; not to touch the chemically treated surfaces. The infants, aged persons or any allergic person should not be present at the time of treatment. And after the treatment you can stay immediately in the premises after cleaning.</string>
    <string name="pc_ans8_200">2Yes. It varies from 1 to 10 years on the type of treatment, type of structure / building / premises, level of infestation etc. You can get more information from our service delivery partner after raising a service request.</string>
    <string name="pc_ans9_200">2The charges will be decided after the inspection of the site and it depends on type of treatment, feasibility of treatment, internal furnitures &amp; fixtures, level of infestation, travel cost, time required for treatment etc.</string>

    <string name="rwh_faq_q17_200">2What are the different types of filters available?</string>
    <string name="rwh_faq_a17_200">2There are generally 3 types of filters depending on area and water quality\n1)	Sand filter: These are constructed by brick masonry and filled by pebbles, gravel, and sand. Each layer is separated by wire mesh.\n2)	Charcoal filter: Charcoal filter can be made on site or in a drum. Pebbles, gravel and sand are filled in the drum or chamber. Each layer should be separated by wire mesh. Thin layer of charcoal is used to absorb odour if any.\n3)	PVC pipe filter: This filter is made of PVC pipe of 1 to 1.20 m length; Diameter of pipe depends on the area of roof. Six inches dia. pipe is enough for a 1500 Sq. Ft. roof and 8 inches dia. pipe should be used for roofs more than 1500 Sq. Ft. Pipe is divided into three compartments by wire mesh.</string>
    <string name="rwh_faq_q18_200">2Is it possible to install a Rain Water Harvesting system in a constructed home?</string>

    <string name="rwh_faq_q19_200">2Can existing storage structures/unused water sources be used for RWH?</string>
    <string name="rwh_faq_a19_200">2Instead of constructing recharge structures, existing unused water sources like dried open wells, sumps, defunct borewells, etc can be used for Rain Water Harvesting.</string>
    <string name="rwh_faq_q20_200">2What happens when the rainwater tank is full?</string>
    <string name="rwh_faq_a20_200">2Underground and cellar tanks have to be fitted with an overflow through which the water can flow into the sewage system or an infiltration system. If connected to the sewage system, the overflow should be above the system\'s backed-up water level. If necessary, a backpressure flap should be installed. Above-ground tanks should always be connected to a downpipe filter. This will prevent the water from flowing inward when the rainwater tank is full and instead it will flow through the downpipe into the sewer.</string>
    <string name="rwh_faq_q21_200">2Does the rainwater collected in the rainwater tank remains fresh?</string>
    <string name="rwh_faq_a21_200">2An underground tank is ideal for storing rainwater because the soil protects the tank from light and heat. Algae and microorganisms cannot form due to exposure to sunlight and temperature, ensuring consistent water quality. If you have an above-ground rainwater tank, you must ensure that it is as opaque as possible (Not transparent or translucent) and it should installed away from direct sunlight, to prevent water from warming.</string>
    <string name="rwh_faq_q22_200">2What is not covered in the rainwater harvesting service?</string>

    <string name="pc_faq_q4_200">2What is termite (white ants, दीमक) ?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a4_200">2Subterranean Termites are social insects and live in colonies below ground. They are considered pests because termites enter the house structure through a gap (0.5 mm gap is sufficient) in search of food. Food for termites is household material containing cellulose like wood, wooden furniture, paper and cloth.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q5_200">2How do termites enter the house?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a5_200">2Termites need moisture to survive and spread underground. They usually enter a house from the soil through its foundation or through cracks in the slab, expansion joints, voids in brick and around plumbing. Wood structures in direct contact with the ground are also easy access routes for termites.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q6_200">2Can termites enter concrete?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a6_200">2Termites cannot pass through solid concrete, but they can get through a crack only 1/32nd of an inch wide. Openings this size or bigger often occur where two pieces of concrete abut – like when poured separately – and around plumbing penetrations through the concrete or where the concrete has cracked.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q7_200">2How they harm the house structure?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a7_200">2Termites can hollow out the wood in the structure of your house. They can also damage the inside of the walls, areas around your windows and doors and the wood furniture inside your home.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q8_200">2How to identify termite infestation?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a8_200">2Signs of termite infestation –\na. Mud tube on wall, ceiling and furniture;\nb. Damaged wooden furniture and fixtures;\nc. Scattered wings of alates / swarmers;\nd. Termite mound in the surrounding of the structure;\ne. Mud shelter on the trunk of the trees, dry patches of grass in lawn, surrounding the structure</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q9_200">2What is Pre-Construction Termite treatment?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a9_200">2Pre-Construction termite treatment done to prevent termite infestation in new construction. As a part of the treatment, the layer of soil beneath a planned home is treated with termiticide to offer proactive protection. A pre-foundation termite treatment helps in ridding the soil of termites and creating a long term termite barrier for durability of the structure.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q10_200">2Who can raise the termite treatment request?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a10_200">2Home Builders &amp; Partners registered on Utec Platform can request and avail this service</string>

    <string name="pc_faq_q12_200">2What will the treatment at my site entail?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a12_200">2Pre Construction: During the plinth level, the soil of the whole plinth level will be treated with the chemicals to create a chemical barrier for the termites.\nPost Construction: To provide the treatment, the service provider will drill 12 mm dia holes about 300 mm apart at skirting level. After the treatment, these holes will be sealed with white cement and we will try to match the colour of the wall to have minimum decor disturbance.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q13_200">2How does the treatment work?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a13_200">2The Principle of the treatment is "To create a continuous chemical barrier/zone between the ground and the structure so the ground nesting termites will not attack the structure".</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q14_200">2How many types of termite control treatments are available?</string>
    <!--<string name="pc_faq_a14_200">2There are 2 types of treatments.\na. Pre Construction Anti Termite Treatment - This treatment is ideal for the underconstruction buildings in its early stages. In this treatment, a chemical barrier / zone is created in the soil at plinth level.\nb. Post Construction Anti Termite Treatment - Post construction treatment is done in ready/existing buildings. When the ready structure is infested with termites, termites can be treated by drilling at the wall and floor junction or skirting level and creating the chemical barrier / zone at the bottom of the walls.</string>-->
    <string name="pc_faq_a14_200">2There are 2 said treatments. Pre construction anti termite treatment - This treatment is ideal for the underconstruction buildings in its early stages. In this the chemical barrier / zone is created in the soil at plinth level and this treatment is called "Pre-construction Anti-termite Treatment". And post construction anti termite treatment when the building structure is ready/existing  and infested with termites, this is done by drilling at the wall and floor junction / skirting level and creating the chemical barrier / zone at the bottom of the walls, this treatment is called "Post-construction Anti-termite Treatment".</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q15_200">2For the under construction buildings, does termite treatment cause any disturbance in the process of construction?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a15_200">2The pre-termite foundation treatment is done simultaneously with your construction work before Plinth PCC (Plain Cement Concrete) and does not affect the process of construction.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q16_200">2For an existing building, does termite treatment cause any damage to the structure?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a16_200">2This treatments causes no damage to the structure. To provide the treatment, the service provider will drill 12 mm dia holes about 300 mm apart at skirting level. After the treatment, these holes will be sealed with white cement and we will try to match the colour of the wall to have minimum decor disturbance.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q17_200">2Do the premises have to be vacated at the time of treatment for existing building (post construction treatment)?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a17_200">2No. You can also see the treatment done. The only precaution is to wear a face mask &amp; to not touch the chemically treated surfaces. Infants, aged persons or any allergic person should not be present at the time of treatment. Post the treatment, you can stay in the premises immediately after cleaning.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q18_200">2Is there any warranty for Post Construction termite treatment?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a18_200">2For the post construction treatment, there is a warranty of 5 years, if done for the entire home / building. In case a specific floor of a building needs to be treated, a 1 year warranty would apply. For the warranty to be valid, the treatment must be completely administered as per the process suggested by our Service Partner. You can get more information from our termite treatment delivery partner after raising a service request.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q19_200">2How much does termite treatment cost? </string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a19_200">2Termite treatment charges can be quoted after the inspection of the site. Charges are dependent on the level of infestation, type of treatment, feasibility of treatment, internal furnitures &amp; fixtures, travel cost and time required for treatment. The service delivery partner will share a detailed estimate of cost post inspection.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q20_200">2How much time does the treatment take?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a20_200">2The treatment takes 1 day of time</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q21_200">2Is the site visit paid or free?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a21_200">2Site Inspection is free, but if the location is far away, then logistics costs may be charged which would get adjusted in the final invoice.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q22_200">2What is covered in the termite treatment service?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a22_200">2Sub-terranean termites (ground nesting termites) are only covered in the anti-termite treatment. Since these are the ground nesting termites which grow and travel through the soil, hence the treatment of creating a chemical barrier around the house stops these termites from infesting the house.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q23_200">2What is not covered in the termite treatment service?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a23_200">2Dry-wood termites infestation, which are usually experienced in the coastal regions are not covered under the treatment. Since, these termites are wood nesting termites, they grow inside the wood hence the chemical barrier at foundation level doesn\'t affect them.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q24_200">2For Pre-Construction treatment, do I need to repeat the treatment after the warranty period?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a24_200">2Once the treatment is done, if the created chemical barrier is disturbed somehow, then we need to re-do the treatment and it will charge extra to the customer. Otherwise, the treatment doesn\'t need to be re-done even after the warranty period is over.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q25_200">2For post construction treatment, do I need to repeat the treatment after the warranty period?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a25_200">2After the expiry of the warranty period, customer needs to re-do the post- construction Anti-termite treatment.</string>

    <string name="verandah_description_3">3Ideal location: The ideal place for Verandah is in the North or East direction.\n\nHeight of roof and floor: According to Vaastu, a Verandah should be open. But, if there is a need for a roof, it should be constructed with cement, avoiding the use of tin.The floor and roof of the Verandah should always be lower than the floor and ceiling of the main building. A verandah usually is an open space and is prone to direct sunlight and heavy rains. Having a lower floor level and roof height makes it possible to maintain a cooler temperature.\n\nFlowerpot position: We usually place flower pots in our Verandah, and it has been advised to keep them in the North-East direction as we get a good supply of sunlight in this direction, essential for the sustenance of plants and flowers.\n\nA trap in the Verandah should be made for the sole purpose of draining run-off water. It should never be placed in the South-West side of the Verandah.\n\nShape of Verandah: The ideal shape of a Verandah is squares and rectangles.\n\nWater pools or fountains: It is advisable to build water pools or fountains in the Verandah. These fountains should face the North-East because the ruling element of the North-East zone is water.</string>
    <string name="underground_tank_description_3">3Ideal location: An underground water tank should be dug in the northeast direction. Avoid digging on the diagonal connecting northeast and southwest\n\nAvoid any water source/tank towards the northwest or southeast.</string>
    <string name="main_entrance_description_3">3Do not align with the main gate: Aligning the house\'s main gate with the entrance door along the same line is not considered good. It will avoid the direct flow of energy.\n\nAvoid shadows on the main door: You should make sure that no shadow falls on the main door, especially those of trees and buildings.\n\nSize &amp; style of the door: The main Entrance of your house should be larger than any other door of the home. It is advisable to have the main door in two parts instead of just one.\n\nNumber of risers in steps: Make sure that the number of risers in entrance steps is in odd numbers. Also, the main Entrance should be higher than the approach way or pathway.\n\nNameplate: Having a nameplate on the main door or on the compound wall of the house is believed to invite good health, prosperity, and wealth into the home.\n\nDoor material: Avoid metals for the door or even for the frame of the door. </string>
    <string name="center_description_3">3The central part of a building is termed Brahmasthan and is regarded as a sacred and powerful zone in Vastu.\n\nEnsure you keep the centre of the house clean, calm and clutter-free.\n\nSoft colours such as white, yellow or light green are recommended for adoring the Brahmasthan.</string>
    <string name="north_description_3">3North is among the most promising directions and is dedicated to Kuber, the God of wealth and prosperity.\n\nThis direction should always be more open, beautiful and allow the entrance of light. and thus, it is the favourable direction for the entrance of the home, porch and verandah</string>
    <string name="east_description_3">3East is known to be a compelling direction, and it is owned by the Hindu deity, Indra.\n\nAfter north, east is the most favourable direction for openings like doors, windows and ventilation.\n\nIt is a good direction for the home entrance, porch, verandah, bedrooms, living room and kitchen.</string>
    <string name="west_description_3">3West direction is known for stability in life, and the Hindu deity, Varun, owns it.\n\nIt is not advisable to have larger openings from this direction.\n\nIt is a favourable direction for bedrooms, kitchen and porch.\n\nYou should altogether avoid open spaces and puja room in this direction.</string>
    <string name="south_description_3">3The owner of the southern direction is a deity called Yam.\n\nThis direction should not have larger openings, and it is advisable to have enclosed spaces or areas with minimum openings here.\n\nIt is also an ideal direction for a master bedroom.</string>
    <string name="north_east_description_3">3Kitchens should not be designed on the northeastern side of the house.\n\nBedrooms and bathrooms too need to be avoided in this direction.\n\nIt is recommended to use water features such as a small water fountain in the northeast corner.\n\nIt is a favourable location for puja rooms.</string>
    <string name="north_west_description_3">3Openings in the northwest direction are favourable.\n\nIt is advisable to have a children\'s bedroom in this location.\n\nIt is favourable to have the kitchen in this direction.\n\nThis direction is favourable for the entrance of basement parking.\n\nIt is a good location for parking.</string>
    <string name="south_east_description_3">3It is favorable for adults to keep their heads towards the southern and eastern directions while sleeping.\n\nSouth eastern location is not favourable for master bedrooms and underground water bodies.\n\nHowever, guest rooms are recommended in this location.\n\nYou can place the cooking gas in the southeast direction. The cook should face east while cooking.\n\nGas cylinders should be kept in this direction.</string>
    <string name="south_west_description_3">3Overhead water tanks should be placed in this direction.\n\nIt is recommended to store annual stock of granary in the southwest corner.\n\nBedrooms must be avoided in this direction.\n\nKitchens must not be designed in this direction.\n\nPuja rooms must also be avoided in this direction.</string>

    <string name="rwh_ans16_3">3"There are generally 3 types of filters\n1)	Sand filter: These are constructed by brick masonry and filled by pebbles, gravel, and sand. Each layer is separated by wire mesh.\n2)	Charcoal filter: Charcoal filter can be made on site or in a drum. Pebbles, gravel and sand are filled in the drum or chamber. Each layer should be separated by wire mesh. Thin layer of charcoal is used to absorb odour if any.\n3)	PVC pipe filter: This filter is made of PVC pipe of 1 to 1.20 m length; Diameter of pipe depends on the area of roof. Six inches dia. pipe is enough for a 1500 Sq. Ft. roof and 8 inches dia. pipe should be used for roofs more than 1500 Sq. Ft. Pipe is divided into three compartments by wire mesh."</string>
    <string name="rwh_ans17_3">3Yes certainly, RWH systems need not necessarily be installed in newly built houses, it can also be installed in houses which are already been built.</string>
    <string name="rwh_ans18_3">3Existing unused structures like dried open wells, sumps etc can be used for RWH as also defunct borewells, instead of constructing recharge structures. This will also reduce the total cost.</string>
    <string name="rwh_ans19_3">3"Underground and cellar tanks have to be fitted with an overflow through which the water can flow into the sewage system or an infiltration system.
If connected to the sewage system, the overflow should be above the system's backed-up water level. If necessary, a backpressure flap should be installed. Above-ground tanks should always be connected to a downpipe filter. This will prevent the water from flowing inward when the rainwater tank is full and instead it will flow through the downpipe into the sewer."</string>
    <string name="rwh_ans20_3">3An underground tank is ideal for storing rainwater because the soil protects the tank from light and heat. Algae and microorganisms cannot form due to the darkness and temperature, ensuring consistent water quality. You should also ensure that an above-ground rainwater tank is as opaque  as possible (Not transparent or translucent or impenetrable to light). To avoid the water warming up too much, it should installed out of direct sunlight.</string>
    <string name="pc_quest1_3">3What is termite (white ants) ?</string>

    <string name="pc_quest8_3">3Is there any warranty for this treatment ?</string>
    <string name="pc_quest9_3">3How much does it cost ?</string>
    <string name="pc_ans1_3">3Termites (sub terranean)  are social insects and live in colonies below ground. The worker termites enter our structure through a gap (0.5 mm gap is sufficient for them)  in search of food (cellulosic material). Material containing cellulose like wood (furniture) , paper &amp; cloth is attacked by them.</string>
    <string name="pc_ans2_3">3Signs of termite infestation – a) Mud tube on wall, ceiling and furniture ; b) Damaged wooden furniture and fixtures ; c) scattered wings of alates / swammers ; d) Termite mound in the surrounding of the structure ; d) mud shelter on the trunk of the trees, dry patches of grass in lawn,  surrounding the structure</string>
    <string name="pc_ans3_3">3The Principle of the treatment is " To create a continuous chemical barrier / zone in between the ground and the structure so the ground nesting termites will not attack the structure ".</string>
    <string name="pc_ans4_3">3There are 2 said treatments. Pre construction anti termite treatment - This treatment is ideal for the underconstruction buildings in its early stages. In this the chemical barrier / zone is created in the soil at plinth level and this treatment is called "Pre-construction Anti-termite Treatment". And post construction anti termite treatment when the building structure is ready/existing  and infested with termites, this is done by drilling at the wall and floor junction / skirting level and creating the chemical barrier / zone at the bottom of the walls, this treatment is called "Post-construction Anti-termite Treatment".</string>

    <string name="pc_ans5_3">3No. This is done simultaneously with your construction work before plinth PCC.</string>
    <string name="pc_ans6_3">3No. The service provider will drill 12 mm dia holes @ 300 mm apart at skirting level. These holes will be sealed with white cement and we will try to match the colour of the wall to have minimum decor disturbance.</string>
    <string name="pc_ans7_3">3No. You can also see the treatment done and the only precaution is to wear a face mask &amp; not to touch the chemically treated surfaces. The infants, aged persons or any allergic person should not be present at the time of treatment. And after the treatment you can stay immediately in the premises after cleaning.</string>
    <string name="pc_ans8_3">3Yes. It varies from 1 to 10 years on the type of treatment, type of structure / building / premises, level of infestation etc. You can get more information from our service delivery partner after raising a service request.</string>
    <string name="pc_ans9_3">3The charges will be decided after the inspection of the site and it depends on type of treatment, feasibility of treatment, internal furnitures &amp; fixtures, level of infestation, travel cost, time required for treatment etc.</string>

    <string name="rwh_faq_q17_3">3What are the different types of filters available?</string>
    <string name="rwh_faq_a17_3">3There are generally 3 types of filters depending on area and water quality\n1)	Sand filter: These are constructed by brick masonry and filled by pebbles, gravel, and sand. Each layer is separated by wire mesh.\n2)	Charcoal filter: Charcoal filter can be made on site or in a drum. Pebbles, gravel and sand are filled in the drum or chamber. Each layer should be separated by wire mesh. Thin layer of charcoal is used to absorb odour if any.\n3)	PVC pipe filter: This filter is made of PVC pipe of 1 to 1.20 m length; Diameter of pipe depends on the area of roof. Six inches dia. pipe is enough for a 1500 Sq. Ft. roof and 8 inches dia. pipe should be used for roofs more than 1500 Sq. Ft. Pipe is divided into three compartments by wire mesh.</string>
    <string name="rwh_faq_q18_3">3Is it possible to install a Rain Water Harvesting system in a constructed home?</string>

    <string name="rwh_faq_q19_3">3Can existing storage structures/unused water sources be used for RWH?</string>
    <string name="rwh_faq_a19_3">3Instead of constructing recharge structures, existing unused water sources like dried open wells, sumps, defunct borewells, etc can be used for Rain Water Harvesting.</string>
    <string name="rwh_faq_q20_3">3What happens when the rainwater tank is full?</string>
    <string name="rwh_faq_a20_3">3Underground and cellar tanks have to be fitted with an overflow through which the water can flow into the sewage system or an infiltration system. If connected to the sewage system, the overflow should be above the system\'s backed-up water level. If necessary, a backpressure flap should be installed. Above-ground tanks should always be connected to a downpipe filter. This will prevent the water from flowing inward when the rainwater tank is full and instead it will flow through the downpipe into the sewer.</string>
    <string name="rwh_faq_q21_3">3Does the rainwater collected in the rainwater tank remains fresh?</string>
    <string name="rwh_faq_a21_3">3An underground tank is ideal for storing rainwater because the soil protects the tank from light and heat. Algae and microorganisms cannot form due to exposure to sunlight and temperature, ensuring consistent water quality. If you have an above-ground rainwater tank, you must ensure that it is as opaque as possible (Not transparent or translucent) and it should installed away from direct sunlight, to prevent water from warming.</string>
    <string name="rwh_faq_q22_3">3What is not covered in the rainwater harvesting service?</string>
    <string name="rwh_faq_a22_3">3The installation of Underground water tank or borewell would not be done by the service provider under Rainwater Harvesting Service.</string>

    <string name="pc_faq_q4_3">3What is termite (white ants, दीमक) ?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a4_3">3Subterranean Termites are social insects and live in colonies below ground. They are considered pests because termites enter the house structure through a gap (0.5 mm gap is sufficient) in search of food. Food for termites is household material containing cellulose like wood, wooden furniture, paper and cloth.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q5_3">3How do termites enter the house?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a5_3">3Termites need moisture to survive and spread underground. They usually enter a house from the soil through its foundation or through cracks in the slab, expansion joints, voids in brick and around plumbing. Wood structures in direct contact with the ground are also easy access routes for termites.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q6_3">3Can termites enter concrete?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a6_3">3Termites cannot pass through solid concrete, but they can get through a crack only 1/32nd of an inch wide. Openings this size or bigger often occur where two pieces of concrete abut – like when poured separately – and around plumbing penetrations through the concrete or where the concrete has cracked.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q7_3">3How they harm the house structure?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a7_3">3Termites can hollow out the wood in the structure of your house. They can also damage the inside of the walls, areas around your windows and doors and the wood furniture inside your home.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q8_3">3How to identify termite infestation?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a8_3">3Signs of termite infestation –\na. Mud tube on wall, ceiling and furniture;\nb. Damaged wooden furniture and fixtures;\nc. Scattered wings of alates / swarmers;\nd. Termite mound in the surrounding of the structure;\ne. Mud shelter on the trunk of the trees, dry patches of grass in lawn, surrounding the structure</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q9_3">3What is Pre-Construction Termite treatment?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a9_3">3Pre-Construction termite treatment done to prevent termite infestation in new construction. As a part of the treatment, the layer of soil beneath a planned home is treated with termiticide to offer proactive protection. A pre-foundation termite treatment helps in ridding the soil of termites and creating a long term termite barrier for durability of the structure.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q10_3">3Who can raise the termite treatment request?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a10_3">3Home Builders &amp; Partners registered on Utec Platform can request and avail this service</string>

    <string name="pc_faq_a11_3">3Termite Treatment is a paid service. Payment is to be made directly to our partner assigned for service delivery. No payment is to be done to Utec.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q12_3">3What will the treatment at my site entail?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a12_3">3Pre Construction: During the plinth level, the soil of the whole plinth level will be treated with the chemicals to create a chemical barrier for the termites.\nPost Construction: To provide the treatment, the service provider will drill 12 mm dia holes about 300 mm apart at skirting level. After the treatment, these holes will be sealed with white cement and we will try to match the colour of the wall to have minimum decor disturbance.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q13_3">3How does the treatment work?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a13_3">3The Principle of the treatment is "To create a continuous chemical barrier/zone between the ground and the structure so the ground nesting termites will not attack the structure".</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q14_3">3How many types of termite control treatments are available?</string>
    <!--<string name="pc_faq_a14_3">3There are 2 types of treatments.\na. Pre Construction Anti Termite Treatment - This treatment is ideal for the underconstruction buildings in its early stages. In this treatment, a chemical barrier / zone is created in the soil at plinth level.\nb. Post Construction Anti Termite Treatment - Post construction treatment is done in ready/existing buildings. When the ready structure is infested with termites, termites can be treated by drilling at the wall and floor junction or skirting level and creating the chemical barrier / zone at the bottom of the walls.</string>-->
    <string name="pc_faq_a14_3">3There are 2 said treatments. Pre construction anti termite treatment - This treatment is ideal for the underconstruction buildings in its early stages. In this the chemical barrier / zone is created in the soil at plinth level and this treatment is called "Pre-construction Anti-termite Treatment". And post construction anti termite treatment when the building structure is ready/existing  and infested with termites, this is done by drilling at the wall and floor junction / skirting level and creating the chemical barrier / zone at the bottom of the walls, this treatment is called "Post-construction Anti-termite Treatment".</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q15_3">3For the under construction buildings, does termite treatment cause any disturbance in the process of construction?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a15_3">3The pre-termite foundation treatment is done simultaneously with your construction work before Plinth PCC (Plain Cement Concrete) and does not affect the process of construction.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q16_3">3For an existing building, does termite treatment cause any damage to the structure?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a16_3">3This treatments causes no damage to the structure. To provide the treatment, the service provider will drill 12 mm dia holes about 300 mm apart at skirting level. After the treatment, these holes will be sealed with white cement and we will try to match the colour of the wall to have minimum decor disturbance.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q17_3">3Do the premises have to be vacated at the time of treatment for existing building (post construction treatment)?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a17_3">3No. You can also see the treatment done. The only precaution is to wear a face mask &amp; to not touch the chemically treated surfaces. Infants, aged persons or any allergic person should not be present at the time of treatment. Post the treatment, you can stay in the premises immediately after cleaning.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q18_3">3Is there any warranty for Post Construction termite treatment?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a18_3">3For the post construction treatment, there is a warranty of 5 years, if done for the entire home / building. In case a specific floor of a building needs to be treated, a 1 year warranty would apply. For the warranty to be valid, the treatment must be completely administered as per the process suggested by our Service Partner. You can get more information from our termite treatment delivery partner after raising a service request.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q19_3">3How much does termite treatment cost? </string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a19_3">3Termite treatment charges can be quoted after the inspection of the site. Charges are dependent on the level of infestation, type of treatment, feasibility of treatment, internal furnitures &amp; fixtures, travel cost and time required for treatment. The service delivery partner will share a detailed estimate of cost post inspection.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q20_3">3How much time does the treatment take?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a20_3">3The treatment takes 1 day of time</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q21_3">3Is the site visit paid or free?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a21_3">3Site Inspection is free, but if the location is far away, then logistics costs may be charged which would get adjusted in the final invoice.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q22_3">3What is covered in the termite treatment service?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a22_3">3Sub-terranean termites (ground nesting termites) are only covered in the anti-termite treatment. Since these are the ground nesting termites which grow and travel through the soil, hence the treatment of creating a chemical barrier around the house stops these termites from infesting the house.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q23_3">3What is not covered in the termite treatment service?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a23_3">3Dry-wood termites infestation, which are usually experienced in the coastal regions are not covered under the treatment. Since, these termites are wood nesting termites, they grow inside the wood hence the chemical barrier at foundation level doesn\'t affect them.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q24_3">3For Pre-Construction treatment, do I need to repeat the treatment after the warranty period?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a24_3">3Once the treatment is done, if the created chemical barrier is disturbed somehow, then we need to re-do the treatment and it will charge extra to the customer. Otherwise, the treatment doesn\'t need to be re-done even after the warranty period is over.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q25_3">3For post construction treatment, do I need to repeat the treatment after the warranty period?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a25_3">3After the expiry of the warranty period, customer needs to re-do the post- construction Anti-termite treatment.</string>

    <string name="rwh_ans16_4">4"There are generally 3 types of filters\n1)	Sand filter: These are constructed by brick masonry and filled by pebbles, gravel, and sand. Each layer is separated by wire mesh.\n2)	Charcoal filter: Charcoal filter can be made on site or in a drum. Pebbles, gravel and sand are filled in the drum or chamber. Each layer should be separated by wire mesh. Thin layer of charcoal is used to absorb odour if any.\n3)	PVC pipe filter: This filter is made of PVC pipe of 1 to 1.20 m length; Diameter of pipe depends on the area of roof. Six inches dia. pipe is enough for a 1500 Sq. Ft. roof and 8 inches dia. pipe should be used for roofs more than 1500 Sq. Ft. Pipe is divided into three compartments by wire mesh."</string>
    <string name="rwh_ans17_4">4Yes certainly, RWH systems need not necessarily be installed in newly built houses, it can also be installed in houses which are already been built.</string>
    <string name="rwh_ans18_4">4Existing unused structures like dried open wells, sumps etc can be used for RWH as also defunct borewells, instead of constructing recharge structures. This will also reduce the total cost.</string>
    <string name="rwh_ans19_4">4"Underground and cellar tanks have to be fitted with an overflow through which the water can flow into the sewage system or an infiltration system.
If connected to the sewage system, the overflow should be above the system's backed-up water level. If necessary, a backpressure flap should be installed. Above-ground tanks should always be connected to a downpipe filter. This will prevent the water from flowing inward when the rainwater tank is full and instead it will flow through the downpipe into the sewer."</string>
    <string name="rwh_ans20_4">4An underground tank is ideal for storing rainwater because the soil protects the tank from light and heat. Algae and microorganisms cannot form due to the darkness and temperature, ensuring consistent water quality. You should also ensure that an above-ground rainwater tank is as opaque  as possible (Not transparent or translucent or impenetrable to light). To avoid the water warming up too much, it should installed out of direct sunlight.</string>
    <string name="pc_quest1_4">4What is termite (white ants) ?</string>
    <string name="pc_quest2_4">4How will I know my premise is infested by termites ?</string>

    <string name="pc_quest4_4">4How is this treatment done ?</string>
    <string name="pc_quest5_4">4For the under construction buildings, is there any disturbance in the process of construction ?</string>

    <string name="pc_quest8_4">4Is there any warranty for this treatment ?</string>
    <string name="pc_quest9_4">4How much does it cost ?</string>
    <string name="pc_ans1_4">4Termites (sub terranean)  are social insects and live in colonies below ground. The worker termites enter our structure through a gap (0.5 mm gap is sufficient for them)  in search of food (cellulosic material). Material containing cellulose like wood (furniture) , paper &amp; cloth is attacked by them.</string>
    <string name="pc_ans2_4">4Signs of termite infestation – a) Mud tube on wall, ceiling and furniture ; b) Damaged wooden furniture and fixtures ; c) scattered wings of alates / swammers ; d) Termite mound in the surrounding of the structure ; d) mud shelter on the trunk of the trees, dry patches of grass in lawn,  surrounding the structure</string>
    <string name="pc_ans3_4">4The Principle of the treatment is " To create a continuous chemical barrier / zone in between the ground and the structure so the ground nesting termites will not attack the structure ".</string>
    <string name="pc_ans4_4">4There are 2 said treatments. Pre construction anti termite treatment - This treatment is ideal for the underconstruction buildings in its early stages. In this the chemical barrier / zone is created in the soil at plinth level and this treatment is called "Pre-construction Anti-termite Treatment". And post construction anti termite treatment when the building structure is ready/existing  and infested with termites, this is done by drilling at the wall and floor junction / skirting level and creating the chemical barrier / zone at the bottom of the walls, this treatment is called "Post-construction Anti-termite Treatment".</string>

    <string name="pc_ans5_4">4No. This is done simultaneously with your construction work before plinth PCC.</string>
    <string name="pc_ans6_4">4No. The service provider will drill 12 mm dia holes @ 300 mm apart at skirting level. These holes will be sealed with white cement and we will try to match the colour of the wall to have minimum decor disturbance.</string>
    <string name="pc_ans7_4">4No. You can also see the treatment done and the only precaution is to wear a face mask &amp; not to touch the chemically treated surfaces. The infants, aged persons or any allergic person should not be present at the time of treatment. And after the treatment you can stay immediately in the premises after cleaning.</string>
    <string name="pc_ans8_4">4Yes. It varies from 1 to 10 years on the type of treatment, type of structure / building / premises, level of infestation etc. You can get more information from our service delivery partner after raising a service request.</string>
    <string name="pc_ans9_4">4The charges will be decided after the inspection of the site and it depends on type of treatment, feasibility of treatment, internal furnitures &amp; fixtures, level of infestation, travel cost, time required for treatment etc.</string>

    <string name="rwh_faq_a8_4">41. If you are planning to store the rainwater for daily usage, then you need to have an underground concrete tank as collection point.\n2. The slope  of the rooftop and the water outlets direction should be towards borewell/Underground water tank so as to reduce the material requirement and hence costs during the final installation</string>
    <string name="rwh_faq_q9_4">4Which is the preferred process for rainwater harvesting?</string>
    <string name="rwh_faq_a9_4">4There are two types of processes for Rain Water Harvesting: Filter Process and Soak Pit System. Filter process is recommended for normal roof size(upto 3000 sqft). Soak pit system only for bigger Roof sizes(>3000 sqft) and industrial use</string>

    <string name="rwh_faq_q17_4">4What are the different types of filters available?</string>
    <string name="rwh_faq_a17_4">4There are generally 3 types of filters depending on area and water quality\n1)	Sand filter: These are constructed by brick masonry and filled by pebbles, gravel, and sand. Each layer is separated by wire mesh.\n2)	Charcoal filter: Charcoal filter can be made on site or in a drum. Pebbles, gravel and sand are filled in the drum or chamber. Each layer should be separated by wire mesh. Thin layer of charcoal is used to absorb odour if any.\n3)	PVC pipe filter: This filter is made of PVC pipe of 1 to 1.20 m length; Diameter of pipe depends on the area of roof. Six inches dia. pipe is enough for a 1500 Sq. Ft. roof and 8 inches dia. pipe should be used for roofs more than 1500 Sq. Ft. Pipe is divided into three compartments by wire mesh.</string>
    <string name="rwh_faq_q18_4">4Is it possible to install a Rain Water Harvesting system in a constructed home?</string>
    <string name="rwh_faq_a18_4">4Yes. Rain Water Harvesting systems need not necessarily be installed in newly built houses. They can also be installed in houses which are already been built.</string>
    <string name="rwh_faq_q19_4">4Can existing storage structures/unused water sources be used for RWH?</string>
    <string name="rwh_faq_a19_4">4Instead of constructing recharge structures, existing unused water sources like dried open wells, sumps, defunct borewells, etc can be used for Rain Water Harvesting.</string>
    <string name="rwh_faq_q20_4">4What happens when the rainwater tank is full?</string>
    <string name="rwh_faq_a20_4">4Underground and cellar tanks have to be fitted with an overflow through which the water can flow into the sewage system or an infiltration system. If connected to the sewage system, the overflow should be above the system\'s backed-up water level. If necessary, a backpressure flap should be installed. Above-ground tanks should always be connected to a downpipe filter. This will prevent the water from flowing inward when the rainwater tank is full and instead it will flow through the downpipe into the sewer.</string>
    <string name="rwh_faq_q21_4">4Does the rainwater collected in the rainwater tank remains fresh?</string>
    <string name="rwh_faq_a21_4">4An underground tank is ideal for storing rainwater because the soil protects the tank from light and heat. Algae and microorganisms cannot form due to exposure to sunlight and temperature, ensuring consistent water quality. If you have an above-ground rainwater tank, you must ensure that it is as opaque as possible (Not transparent or translucent) and it should installed away from direct sunlight, to prevent water from warming.</string>
    <string name="rwh_faq_q22_4">4What is not covered in the rainwater harvesting service?</string>
    <string name="rwh_faq_a22_4">4The installation of Underground water tank or borewell would not be done by the service provider under Rainwater Harvesting Service.</string>

    <string name="pc_faq_q3_4">4Is there a warranty on the service?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a3_4">4The Pre-construction termite treatment done at foundation level comes with a warranty of 10 years. For the warranty to be valid, the treatment must be completely administered as per the process suggested by our Service Partner. You can get more information from our termite treatment delivery partner after raising a service request.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q4_4">4What is termite (white ants, दीमक) ?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a4_4">4Subterranean Termites are social insects and live in colonies below ground. They are considered pests because termites enter the house structure through a gap (0.5 mm gap is sufficient) in search of food. Food for termites is household material containing cellulose like wood, wooden furniture, paper and cloth.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q5_4">4How do termites enter the house?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a5_4">4Termites need moisture to survive and spread underground. They usually enter a house from the soil through its foundation or through cracks in the slab, expansion joints, voids in brick and around plumbing. Wood structures in direct contact with the ground are also easy access routes for termites.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q6_4">4Can termites enter concrete?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a6_4">4Termites cannot pass through solid concrete, but they can get through a crack only 1/32nd of an inch wide. Openings this size or bigger often occur where two pieces of concrete abut – like when poured separately – and around plumbing penetrations through the concrete or where the concrete has cracked.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q7_4">4How they harm the house structure?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a7_4">4Termites can hollow out the wood in the structure of your house. They can also damage the inside of the walls, areas around your windows and doors and the wood furniture inside your home.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q8_4">4How to identify termite infestation?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a8_4">4Signs of termite infestation –\na. Mud tube on wall, ceiling and furniture;\nb. Damaged wooden furniture and fixtures;\nc. Scattered wings of alates / swarmers;\nd. Termite mound in the surrounding of the structure;\ne. Mud shelter on the trunk of the trees, dry patches of grass in lawn, surrounding the structure</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q9_4">4What is Pre-Construction Termite treatment?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a9_4">4Pre-Construction termite treatment done to prevent termite infestation in new construction. As a part of the treatment, the layer of soil beneath a planned home is treated with termiticide to offer proactive protection. A pre-foundation termite treatment helps in ridding the soil of termites and creating a long term termite barrier for durability of the structure.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q10_4">4Who can raise the termite treatment request?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a10_4">4Home Builders &amp; Partners registered on Utec Platform can request and avail this service</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q11_4">4Is this is a paid service?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a11_4">4Termite Treatment is a paid service. Payment is to be made directly to our partner assigned for service delivery. No payment is to be done to Utec.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q12_4">4What will the treatment at my site entail?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a12_4">4Pre Construction: During the plinth level, the soil of the whole plinth level will be treated with the chemicals to create a chemical barrier for the termites.\nPost Construction: To provide the treatment, the service provider will drill 12 mm dia holes about 300 mm apart at skirting level. After the treatment, these holes will be sealed with white cement and we will try to match the colour of the wall to have minimum decor disturbance.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q13_4">4How does the treatment work?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a13_4">4The Principle of the treatment is "To create a continuous chemical barrier/zone between the ground and the structure so the ground nesting termites will not attack the structure".</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q14_4">4How many types of termite control treatments are available?</string>
    <!--<string name="pc_faq_a14_4">4There are 2 types of treatments.\na. Pre Construction Anti Termite Treatment - This treatment is ideal for the underconstruction buildings in its early stages. In this treatment, a chemical barrier / zone is created in the soil at plinth level.\nb. Post Construction Anti Termite Treatment - Post construction treatment is done in ready/existing buildings. When the ready structure is infested with termites, termites can be treated by drilling at the wall and floor junction or skirting level and creating the chemical barrier / zone at the bottom of the walls.</string>-->
    <string name="pc_faq_a14_4">4There are 2 said treatments. Pre construction anti termite treatment - This treatment is ideal for the underconstruction buildings in its early stages. In this the chemical barrier / zone is created in the soil at plinth level and this treatment is called "Pre-construction Anti-termite Treatment". And post construction anti termite treatment when the building structure is ready/existing  and infested with termites, this is done by drilling at the wall and floor junction / skirting level and creating the chemical barrier / zone at the bottom of the walls, this treatment is called "Post-construction Anti-termite Treatment".</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q15_4">4For the under construction buildings, does termite treatment cause any disturbance in the process of construction?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a15_4">4The pre-termite foundation treatment is done simultaneously with your construction work before Plinth PCC (Plain Cement Concrete) and does not affect the process of construction.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q16_4">4For an existing building, does termite treatment cause any damage to the structure?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a16_4">4This treatments causes no damage to the structure. To provide the treatment, the service provider will drill 12 mm dia holes about 300 mm apart at skirting level. After the treatment, these holes will be sealed with white cement and we will try to match the colour of the wall to have minimum decor disturbance.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q17_4">4Do the premises have to be vacated at the time of treatment for existing building (post construction treatment)?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a17_4">4No. You can also see the treatment done. The only precaution is to wear a face mask &amp; to not touch the chemically treated surfaces. Infants, aged persons or any allergic person should not be present at the time of treatment. Post the treatment, you can stay in the premises immediately after cleaning.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q18_4">4Is there any warranty for Post Construction termite treatment?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a18_4">4For the post construction treatment, there is a warranty of 5 years, if done for the entire home / building. In case a specific floor of a building needs to be treated, a 1 year warranty would apply. For the warranty to be valid, the treatment must be completely administered as per the process suggested by our Service Partner. You can get more information from our termite treatment delivery partner after raising a service request.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q19_4">4How much does termite treatment cost? </string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a19_4">4Termite treatment charges can be quoted after the inspection of the site. Charges are dependent on the level of infestation, type of treatment, feasibility of treatment, internal furnitures &amp; fixtures, travel cost and time required for treatment. The service delivery partner will share a detailed estimate of cost post inspection.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q20_4">4How much time does the treatment take?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a20_4">4The treatment takes 1 day of time</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q21_4">4Is the site visit paid or free?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a21_4">4Site Inspection is free, but if the location is far away, then logistics costs may be charged which would get adjusted in the final invoice.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q22_4">4What is covered in the termite treatment service?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a22_4">4Sub-terranean termites (ground nesting termites) are only covered in the anti-termite treatment. Since these are the ground nesting termites which grow and travel through the soil, hence the treatment of creating a chemical barrier around the house stops these termites from infesting the house.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q23_4">4What is not covered in the termite treatment service?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a23_4">4Dry-wood termites infestation, which are usually experienced in the coastal regions are not covered under the treatment. Since, these termites are wood nesting termites, they grow inside the wood hence the chemical barrier at foundation level doesn\'t affect them.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q24_4">4For Pre-Construction treatment, do I need to repeat the treatment after the warranty period?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a24_4">4Once the treatment is done, if the created chemical barrier is disturbed somehow, then we need to re-do the treatment and it will charge extra to the customer. Otherwise, the treatment doesn\'t need to be re-done even after the warranty period is over.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q25_4">4For post construction treatment, do I need to repeat the treatment after the warranty period?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a25_4">4After the expiry of the warranty period, customer needs to re-do the post- construction Anti-termite treatment.</string>

    <string name="rwh_ans16_5">5"There are generally 3 types of filters\n1)	Sand filter: These are constructed by brick masonry and filled by pebbles, gravel, and sand. Each layer is separated by wire mesh.\n2)	Charcoal filter: Charcoal filter can be made on site or in a drum. Pebbles, gravel and sand are filled in the drum or chamber. Each layer should be separated by wire mesh. Thin layer of charcoal is used to absorb odour if any.\n3)	PVC pipe filter: This filter is made of PVC pipe of 1 to 1.20 m length; Diameter of pipe depends on the area of roof. Six inches dia. pipe is enough for a 1500 Sq. Ft. roof and 8 inches dia. pipe should be used for roofs more than 1500 Sq. Ft. Pipe is divided into three compartments by wire mesh."</string>
    <string name="rwh_ans17_5">5Yes certainly, RWH systems need not necessarily be installed in newly built houses, it can also be installed in houses which are already been built.</string>
    <string name="rwh_ans18_5">5Existing unused structures like dried open wells, sumps etc can be used for RWH as also defunct borewells, instead of constructing recharge structures. This will also reduce the total cost.</string>
    <string name="rwh_ans19_5">5"Underground and cellar tanks have to be fitted with an overflow through which the water can flow into the sewage system or an infiltration system.
If connected to the sewage system, the overflow should be above the system's backed-up water level. If necessary, a backpressure flap should be installed. Above-ground tanks should always be connected to a downpipe filter. This will prevent the water from flowing inward when the rainwater tank is full and instead it will flow through the downpipe into the sewer."</string>
    <string name="rwh_ans20_5">5An underground tank is ideal for storing rainwater because the soil protects the tank from light and heat. Algae and microorganisms cannot form due to the darkness and temperature, ensuring consistent water quality. You should also ensure that an above-ground rainwater tank is as opaque  as possible (Not transparent or translucent or impenetrable to light). To avoid the water warming up too much, it should installed out of direct sunlight.</string>
    <string name="pc_quest1_5">5What is termite (white ants) ?</string>
    <string name="pc_quest2_5">5How will I know my premise is infested by termites ?</string>
    <string name="pc_quest3_5">5What are the control measures or solutions for this ?</string>
    <string name="pc_quest4_5">5How is this treatment done ?</string>
    <string name="pc_quest5_5">5For the under construction buildings, is there any disturbance in the process of construction ?</string>
    <string name="pc_quest6_5">5 For an existing building, is there any damage to the walls / structure</string>
    <string name="pc_quest7_5">5I have to vacate the premises at the time of treatment ?</string>
    <string name="pc_quest8_5">5Is there any warranty for this treatment ?</string>
    <string name="pc_quest9_5">5How much does it cost ?</string>
    <string name="pc_ans1_5">5Termites (sub terranean)  are social insects and live in colonies below ground. The worker termites enter our structure through a gap (0.5 mm gap is sufficient for them)  in search of food (cellulosic material). Material containing cellulose like wood (furniture) , paper &amp; cloth is attacked by them.</string>
    <string name="pc_ans2_5">5Signs of termite infestation – a) Mud tube on wall, ceiling and furniture ; b) Damaged wooden furniture and fixtures ; c) scattered wings of alates / swammers ; d) Termite mound in the surrounding of the structure ; d) mud shelter on the trunk of the trees, dry patches of grass in lawn,  surrounding the structure</string>
    <string name="pc_ans3_5">5The Principle of the treatment is " To create a continuous chemical barrier / zone in between the ground and the structure so the ground nesting termites will not attack the structure ".</string>
    <string name="pc_ans4_5">5There are 2 said treatments. Pre construction anti termite treatment - This treatment is ideal for the underconstruction buildings in its early stages. In this the chemical barrier / zone is created in the soil at plinth level and this treatment is called "Pre-construction Anti-termite Treatment". And post construction anti termite treatment when the building structure is ready/existing  and infested with termites, this is done by drilling at the wall and floor junction / skirting level and creating the chemical barrier / zone at the bottom of the walls, this treatment is called "Post-construction Anti-termite Treatment".</string>

    <string name="pc_ans5_5">5No. This is done simultaneously with your construction work before plinth PCC.</string>
    <string name="pc_ans6_5">5No. The service provider will drill 12 mm dia holes @ 300 mm apart at skirting level. These holes will be sealed with white cement and we will try to match the colour of the wall to have minimum decor disturbance.</string>
    <string name="pc_ans7_5">5No. You can also see the treatment done and the only precaution is to wear a face mask &amp; not to touch the chemically treated surfaces. The infants, aged persons or any allergic person should not be present at the time of treatment. And after the treatment you can stay immediately in the premises after cleaning.</string>
    <string name="pc_ans8_5">5Yes. It varies from 1 to 10 years on the type of treatment, type of structure / building / premises, level of infestation etc. You can get more information from our service delivery partner after raising a service request.</string>
    <string name="pc_ans9_5">5The charges will be decided after the inspection of the site and it depends on type of treatment, feasibility of treatment, internal furnitures &amp; fixtures, level of infestation, travel cost, time required for treatment etc.</string>

The filter\'s outlet would be connected to the borewell / Underground water tank (whichever provision you have in your plot for Rainwater Harvesting as a pre-requisite) </string>
    <string name="rwh_faq_q4_5">5What is Rain Water Harvesting?</string>
    <string name="rwh_faq_a4_5">5Rain Water Harvesting is the technique to store and conserve rain water for future use through installation of a filter system in a collection tank / borewell at home.

    <string name="rwh_faq_q17_5">5What are the different types of filters available?</string>
    <string name="rwh_faq_a17_5">5There are generally 3 types of filters depending on area and water quality\n1)	Sand filter: These are constructed by brick masonry and filled by pebbles, gravel, and sand. Each layer is separated by wire mesh.\n2)	Charcoal filter: Charcoal filter can be made on site or in a drum. Pebbles, gravel and sand are filled in the drum or chamber. Each layer should be separated by wire mesh. Thin layer of charcoal is used to absorb odour if any.\n3)	PVC pipe filter: This filter is made of PVC pipe of 1 to 1.20 m length; Diameter of pipe depends on the area of roof. Six inches dia. pipe is enough for a 1500 Sq. Ft. roof and 8 inches dia. pipe should be used for roofs more than 1500 Sq. Ft. Pipe is divided into three compartments by wire mesh.</string>

    <string name="rwh_faq_q19_5">5Can existing storage structures/unused water sources be used for RWH?</string>
    <string name="rwh_faq_a19_5">5Instead of constructing recharge structures, existing unused water sources like dried open wells, sumps, defunct borewells, etc can be used for Rain Water Harvesting.</string>
    <string name="rwh_faq_q20_5">5What happens when the rainwater tank is full?</string>
    <string name="rwh_faq_a20_5">5Underground and cellar tanks have to be fitted with an overflow through which the water can flow into the sewage system or an infiltration system. If connected to the sewage system, the overflow should be above the system\'s backed-up water level. If necessary, a backpressure flap should be installed. Above-ground tanks should always be connected to a downpipe filter. This will prevent the water from flowing inward when the rainwater tank is full and instead it will flow through the downpipe into the sewer.</string>
    <string name="rwh_faq_q21_5">5Does the rainwater collected in the rainwater tank remains fresh?</string>
    <string name="rwh_faq_a21_5">5An underground tank is ideal for storing rainwater because the soil protects the tank from light and heat. Algae and microorganisms cannot form due to exposure to sunlight and temperature, ensuring consistent water quality. If you have an above-ground rainwater tank, you must ensure that it is as opaque as possible (Not transparent or translucent) and it should installed away from direct sunlight, to prevent water from warming.</string>
    <string name="rwh_faq_q22_5">5What is not covered in the rainwater harvesting service?</string>
    <string name="rwh_faq_a22_5">5The installation of Underground water tank or borewell would not be done by the service provider under Rainwater Harvesting Service.</string>

    <string name="pc_faq_q4_5">5What is termite (white ants, दीमक) ?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a4_5">5Subterranean Termites are social insects and live in colonies below ground. They are considered pests because termites enter the house structure through a gap (0.5 mm gap is sufficient) in search of food. Food for termites is household material containing cellulose like wood, wooden furniture, paper and cloth.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q5_5">5How do termites enter the house?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a5_5">5Termites need moisture to survive and spread underground. They usually enter a house from the soil through its foundation or through cracks in the slab, expansion joints, voids in brick and around plumbing. Wood structures in direct contact with the ground are also easy access routes for termites.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q6_5">5Can termites enter concrete?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a6_5">5Termites cannot pass through solid concrete, but they can get through a crack only 1/32nd of an inch wide. Openings this size or bigger often occur where two pieces of concrete abut – like when poured separately – and around plumbing penetrations through the concrete or where the concrete has cracked.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q7_5">5How they harm the house structure?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a7_5">5Termites can hollow out the wood in the structure of your house. They can also damage the inside of the walls, areas around your windows and doors and the wood furniture inside your home.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q8_5">5How to identify termite infestation?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a8_5">5Signs of termite infestation –\na. Mud tube on wall, ceiling and furniture;\nb. Damaged wooden furniture and fixtures;\nc. Scattered wings of alates / swarmers;\nd. Termite mound in the surrounding of the structure;\ne. Mud shelter on the trunk of the trees, dry patches of grass in lawn, surrounding the structure</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q9_5">5What is Pre-Construction Termite treatment?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a9_5">5Pre-Construction termite treatment done to prevent termite infestation in new construction. As a part of the treatment, the layer of soil beneath a planned home is treated with termiticide to offer proactive protection. A pre-foundation termite treatment helps in ridding the soil of termites and creating a long term termite barrier for durability of the structure.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q10_5">5Who can raise the termite treatment request?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a10_5">5Home Builders &amp; Partners registered on Utec Platform can request and avail this service</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q11_5">5Is this is a paid service?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a11_5">5Termite Treatment is a paid service. Payment is to be made directly to our partner assigned for service delivery. No payment is to be done to Utec.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q12_5">5What will the treatment at my site entail?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a12_5">5Pre Construction: During the plinth level, the soil of the whole plinth level will be treated with the chemicals to create a chemical barrier for the termites.\nPost Construction: To provide the treatment, the service provider will drill 12 mm dia holes about 300 mm apart at skirting level. After the treatment, these holes will be sealed with white cement and we will try to match the colour of the wall to have minimum decor disturbance.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q13_5">5How does the treatment work?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a13_5">5The Principle of the treatment is "To create a continuous chemical barrier/zone between the ground and the structure so the ground nesting termites will not attack the structure".</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q14_5">5How many types of termite control treatments are available?</string>
    <!--<string name="pc_faq_a14_5">5There are 2 types of treatments.\na. Pre Construction Anti Termite Treatment - This treatment is ideal for the underconstruction buildings in its early stages. In this treatment, a chemical barrier / zone is created in the soil at plinth level.\nb. Post Construction Anti Termite Treatment - Post construction treatment is done in ready/existing buildings. When the ready structure is infested with termites, termites can be treated by drilling at the wall and floor junction or skirting level and creating the chemical barrier / zone at the bottom of the walls.</string>-->
    <string name="pc_faq_a14_5">5There are 2 said treatments. Pre construction anti termite treatment - This treatment is ideal for the underconstruction buildings in its early stages. In this the chemical barrier / zone is created in the soil at plinth level and this treatment is called "Pre-construction Anti-termite Treatment". And post construction anti termite treatment when the building structure is ready/existing  and infested with termites, this is done by drilling at the wall and floor junction / skirting level and creating the chemical barrier / zone at the bottom of the walls, this treatment is called "Post-construction Anti-termite Treatment".</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q15_5">5For the under construction buildings, does termite treatment cause any disturbance in the process of construction?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a15_5">5The pre-termite foundation treatment is done simultaneously with your construction work before Plinth PCC (Plain Cement Concrete) and does not affect the process of construction.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q16_5">5For an existing building, does termite treatment cause any damage to the structure?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a16_5">5This treatments causes no damage to the structure. To provide the treatment, the service provider will drill 12 mm dia holes about 300 mm apart at skirting level. After the treatment, these holes will be sealed with white cement and we will try to match the colour of the wall to have minimum decor disturbance.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q17_5">5Do the premises have to be vacated at the time of treatment for existing building (post construction treatment)?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a17_5">5No. You can also see the treatment done. The only precaution is to wear a face mask &amp; to not touch the chemically treated surfaces. Infants, aged persons or any allergic person should not be present at the time of treatment. Post the treatment, you can stay in the premises immediately after cleaning.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q18_5">5Is there any warranty for Post Construction termite treatment?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a18_5">5For the post construction treatment, there is a warranty of 5 years, if done for the entire home / building. In case a specific floor of a building needs to be treated, a 1 year warranty would apply. For the warranty to be valid, the treatment must be completely administered as per the process suggested by our Service Partner. You can get more information from our termite treatment delivery partner after raising a service request.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q19_5">5How much does termite treatment cost? </string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a19_5">5Termite treatment charges can be quoted after the inspection of the site. Charges are dependent on the level of infestation, type of treatment, feasibility of treatment, internal furnitures &amp; fixtures, travel cost and time required for treatment. The service delivery partner will share a detailed estimate of cost post inspection.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q20_5">5How much time does the treatment take?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a20_5">5The treatment takes 1 day of time</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q21_5">5Is the site visit paid or free?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a21_5">5Site Inspection is free, but if the location is far away, then logistics costs may be charged which would get adjusted in the final invoice.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q22_5">5What is covered in the termite treatment service?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a22_5">5Sub-terranean termites (ground nesting termites) are only covered in the anti-termite treatment. Since these are the ground nesting termites which grow and travel through the soil, hence the treatment of creating a chemical barrier around the house stops these termites from infesting the house.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q23_5">5What is not covered in the termite treatment service?</string>

The height of Tulsi Vrindavan should not be more than the plinth level.\n\nWaterbody position: Swimming tanks, wells, fountains, underground water storage tanks, borings, etc., should be in the northeast, the east, or the north direction.\n\nGarden position: Gardens, decorative plants, lawns, etc., should be in the east or the north. The ornamental plants should not be taller than three feet. A small waterfall of three to four feet should be constructed in the east or the north, leaving the northeast or the northwest corner.\n\nPlay swing position and orientation: Play swings should be in the east or north, and they should be swinging towards the east or west.\n\nBench position &amp; orientation: Benches in the open space in the east and the north direction should be in the west or the south direction, and the person should sit facing towards the east or the north.</string>
    <string name="porch_description_6">6Favorable locations: It is advisable to construct a porch between the east and north directions to increase property value.\n\nPorch should not block sunlight: Early morning sunlight is essential for all living beings; therefore, there should be no obstruction on the Porch to block the sun rays from reaching your home.</string>
    <string name="verandah_description_6">6Ideal location: The ideal place for Verandah is in the North or East direction.\n\nHeight of roof and floor: According to Vaastu, a Verandah should be open. But, if there is a need for a roof, it should be constructed with cement, avoiding the use of tin.The floor and roof of the Verandah should always be lower than the floor and ceiling of the main building. A verandah usually is an open space and is prone to direct sunlight and heavy rains. Having a lower floor level and roof height makes it possible to maintain a cooler temperature.\n\nFlowerpot position: We usually place flower pots in our Verandah, and it has been advised to keep them in the North-East direction as we get a good supply of sunlight in this direction, essential for the sustenance of plants and flowers.\n\nA trap in the Verandah should be made for the sole purpose of draining run-off water. It should never be placed in the South-West side of the Verandah.\n\nShape of Verandah: The ideal shape of a Verandah is squares and rectangles.\n\nWater pools or fountains: It is advisable to build water pools or fountains in the Verandah. These fountains should face the North-East because the ruling element of the North-East zone is water.</string>

It will avoid the direct flow of energy.\n\nAvoid shadows on the main door: You should make sure that no shadow falls on the main door, especially those of trees and buildings.\n\nSize &amp; style of the door: The main Entrance of your house should be larger than any other door of the home. It is advisable to have the main door in two parts instead of just one.\n\nNumber of risers in steps: Make sure that the number of risers in entrance steps is in odd numbers. Also, the main Entrance should be higher than the approach way or pathway.\n\nNameplate: Having a nameplate on the main door or on the compound wall of the house is believed to invite good health, prosperity, and wealth into the home.\n\nDoor material: Avoid metals for the door or even for the frame of the door. </string>

With 1st year free AMC. ( post it will be chargeable agreed between both parties). Customers should safely store the warranty and AMC documents with them for any future needs.</string>
    <string name="rwh_ans15_6">6Entire system can be used at full capacity for up to 20 years if Cleaning process done at advised intervals.</string>
    <string name="rwh_ans16_6">6"There are generally 3 types of filters\n1)	Sand filter: These are constructed by brick masonry and filled by pebbles, gravel, and sand. Each layer is separated by wire mesh.\n2)	Charcoal filter: Charcoal filter can be made on site or in a drum. Pebbles, gravel and sand are filled in the drum or chamber. Each layer should be separated by wire mesh. Thin layer of charcoal is used to absorb odour if any.\n3)	PVC pipe filter: This filter is made of PVC pipe of 1 to 1.20 m length; Diameter of pipe depends on the area of roof. Six inches dia. pipe is enough for a 1500 Sq. Ft. roof and 8 inches dia. pipe should be used for roofs more than 1500 Sq. Ft. Pipe is divided into three compartments by wire mesh."</string>
    <string name="rwh_ans17_6">6Yes certainly, RWH systems need not necessarily be installed in newly built houses, it can also be installed in houses which are already been built.</string>
    <string name="rwh_ans18_6">6Existing unused structures like dried open wells, sumps etc can be used for RWH as also defunct borewells, instead of constructing recharge structures. This will also reduce the total cost.</string>
    <string name="rwh_ans19_6">6"Underground and cellar tanks have to be fitted with an overflow through which the water can flow into the sewage system or an infiltration system.
If connected to the sewage system, the overflow should be above the system's backed-up water level. If necessary, a backpressure flap should be installed. Above-ground tanks should always be connected to a downpipe filter. This will prevent the water from flowing inward when the rainwater tank is full and instead it will flow through the downpipe into the sewer."</string>
    <string name="rwh_ans20_6">6An underground tank is ideal for storing rainwater because the soil protects the tank from light and heat. Algae and microorganisms cannot form due to the darkness and temperature, ensuring consistent water quality. You should also ensure that an above-ground rainwater tank is as opaque  as possible (Not transparent or translucent or impenetrable to light). To avoid the water warming up too much, it should installed out of direct sunlight.</string>
    <string name="pc_quest1_6">6What is termite (white ants) ?</string>
    <string name="pc_quest2_6">6How will I know my premise is infested by termites ?</string>

    <string name="pc_quest4_6">6How is this treatment done ?</string>
    <string name="pc_quest5_6">6For the under construction buildings, is there any disturbance in the process of construction ?</string>

    <string name="pc_quest7_6">6I have to vacate the premises at the time of treatment ?</string>
    <string name="pc_quest8_6">6Is there any warranty for this treatment ?</string>
    <string name="pc_quest9_6">6How much does it cost ?</string>
    <string name="pc_ans1_6">6Termites (sub terranean)  are social insects and live in colonies below ground. The worker termites enter our structure through a gap (0.5 mm gap is sufficient for them)  in search of food (cellulosic material). Material containing cellulose like wood (furniture) , paper &amp; cloth is attacked by them.</string>
    <string name="pc_ans2_6">6Signs of termite infestation – a) Mud tube on wall, ceiling and furniture ; b) Damaged wooden furniture and fixtures ; c) scattered wings of alates / swammers ; d) Termite mound in the surrounding of the structure ; d) mud shelter on the trunk of the trees, dry patches of grass in lawn,  surrounding the structure</string>
    <string name="pc_ans3_6">6The Principle of the treatment is " To create a continuous chemical barrier / zone in between the ground and the structure so the ground nesting termites will not attack the structure ".</string>
    <string name="pc_ans4_6">6There are 2 said treatments. Pre construction anti termite treatment - This treatment is ideal for the underconstruction buildings in its early stages. In this the chemical barrier / zone is created in the soil at plinth level and this treatment is called "Pre-construction Anti-termite Treatment". And post construction anti termite treatment when the building structure is ready/existing  and infested with termites, this is done by drilling at the wall and floor junction / skirting level and creating the chemical barrier / zone at the bottom of the walls, this treatment is called "Post-construction Anti-termite Treatment".</string>

    <string name="pc_ans5_6">6No. This is done simultaneously with your construction work before plinth PCC.</string>
    <string name="pc_ans6_6">6No. The service provider will drill 12 mm dia holes @ 300 mm apart at skirting level. These holes will be sealed with white cement and we will try to match the colour of the wall to have minimum decor disturbance.</string>
    <string name="pc_ans7_6">6No. You can also see the treatment done and the only precaution is to wear a face mask &amp; not to touch the chemically treated surfaces. The infants, aged persons or any allergic person should not be present at the time of treatment. And after the treatment you can stay immediately in the premises after cleaning.</string>
    <string name="pc_ans8_6">6Yes. It varies from 1 to 10 years on the type of treatment, type of structure / building / premises, level of infestation etc. You can get more information from our service delivery partner after raising a service request.</string>
    <string name="pc_ans9_6">6The charges will be decided after the inspection of the site and it depends on type of treatment, feasibility of treatment, internal furnitures &amp; fixtures, level of infestation, travel cost, time required for treatment etc.</string>

    <string name="rwh_faq_q17_6">6What are the different types of filters available?</string>
    <string name="rwh_faq_a17_6">6There are generally 3 types of filters depending on area and water quality\n1)	Sand filter: These are constructed by brick masonry and filled by pebbles, gravel, and sand. Each layer is separated by wire mesh.\n2)	Charcoal filter: Charcoal filter can be made on site or in a drum. Pebbles, gravel and sand are filled in the drum or chamber. Each layer should be separated by wire mesh. Thin layer of charcoal is used to absorb odour if any.\n3)	PVC pipe filter: This filter is made of PVC pipe of 1 to 1.20 m length; Diameter of pipe depends on the area of roof. Six inches dia. pipe is enough for a 1500 Sq. Ft. roof and 8 inches dia. pipe should be used for roofs more than 1500 Sq. Ft. Pipe is divided into three compartments by wire mesh.</string>

    <string name="rwh_faq_a19_6">6Instead of constructing recharge structures, existing unused water sources like dried open wells, sumps, defunct borewells, etc can be used for Rain Water Harvesting.</string>
    <string name="rwh_faq_q20_6">6What happens when the rainwater tank is full?</string>
    <string name="rwh_faq_a20_6">6Underground and cellar tanks have to be fitted with an overflow through which the water can flow into the sewage system or an infiltration system. If connected to the sewage system, the overflow should be above the system\'s backed-up water level. If necessary, a backpressure flap should be installed. Above-ground tanks should always be connected to a downpipe filter. This will prevent the water from flowing inward when the rainwater tank is full and instead it will flow through the downpipe into the sewer.</string>
    <string name="rwh_faq_q21_6">6Does the rainwater collected in the rainwater tank remains fresh?</string>
    <string name="rwh_faq_a21_6">6An underground tank is ideal for storing rainwater because the soil protects the tank from light and heat. Algae and microorganisms cannot form due to exposure to sunlight and temperature, ensuring consistent water quality. If you have an above-ground rainwater tank, you must ensure that it is as opaque as possible (Not transparent or translucent) and it should installed away from direct sunlight, to prevent water from warming.</string>
    <string name="rwh_faq_q22_6">6What is not covered in the rainwater harvesting service?</string>

    <string name="pc_faq_q4_6">6What is termite (white ants, दीमक) ?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a4_6">6Subterranean Termites are social insects and live in colonies below ground. They are considered pests because termites enter the house structure through a gap (0.5 mm gap is sufficient) in search of food. Food for termites is household material containing cellulose like wood, wooden furniture, paper and cloth.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q5_6">6How do termites enter the house?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a5_6">6Termites need moisture to survive and spread underground. They usually enter a house from the soil through its foundation or through cracks in the slab, expansion joints, voids in brick and around plumbing. Wood structures in direct contact with the ground are also easy access routes for termites.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q6_6">6Can termites enter concrete?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a6_6">6Termites cannot pass through solid concrete, but they can get through a crack only 1/32nd of an inch wide. Openings this size or bigger often occur where two pieces of concrete abut – like when poured separately – and around plumbing penetrations through the concrete or where the concrete has cracked.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q7_6">6How they harm the house structure?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a7_6">6Termites can hollow out the wood in the structure of your house. They can also damage the inside of the walls, areas around your windows and doors and the wood furniture inside your home.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q8_6">6How to identify termite infestation?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a8_6">6Signs of termite infestation –\na. Mud tube on wall, ceiling and furniture;\nb. Damaged wooden furniture and fixtures;\nc. Scattered wings of alates / swarmers;\nd. Termite mound in the surrounding of the structure;\ne. Mud shelter on the trunk of the trees, dry patches of grass in lawn, surrounding the structure</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q9_6">6What is Pre-Construction Termite treatment?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a9_6">6Pre-Construction termite treatment done to prevent termite infestation in new construction. As a part of the treatment, the layer of soil beneath a planned home is treated with termiticide to offer proactive protection. A pre-foundation termite treatment helps in ridding the soil of termites and creating a long term termite barrier for durability of the structure.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q10_6">6Who can raise the termite treatment request?</string>

    <string name="pc_faq_a11_6">6Termite Treatment is a paid service. Payment is to be made directly to our partner assigned for service delivery. No payment is to be done to Utec.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q12_6">6What will the treatment at my site entail?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a12_6">6Pre Construction: During the plinth level, the soil of the whole plinth level will be treated with the chemicals to create a chemical barrier for the termites.\nPost Construction: To provide the treatment, the service provider will drill 12 mm dia holes about 300 mm apart at skirting level. After the treatment, these holes will be sealed with white cement and we will try to match the colour of the wall to have minimum decor disturbance.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q13_6">6How does the treatment work?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a13_6">6The Principle of the treatment is "To create a continuous chemical barrier/zone between the ground and the structure so the ground nesting termites will not attack the structure".</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q14_6">6How many types of termite control treatments are available?</string>
    <!--<string name="pc_faq_a14_6">6There are 2 types of treatments.\na. Pre Construction Anti Termite Treatment - This treatment is ideal for the underconstruction buildings in its early stages. In this treatment, a chemical barrier / zone is created in the soil at plinth level.\nb. Post Construction Anti Termite Treatment - Post construction treatment is done in ready/existing buildings. When the ready structure is infested with termites, termites can be treated by drilling at the wall and floor junction or skirting level and creating the chemical barrier / zone at the bottom of the walls.</string>-->
    <string name="pc_faq_a14_6">6There are 2 said treatments. Pre construction anti termite treatment - This treatment is ideal for the underconstruction buildings in its early stages. In this the chemical barrier / zone is created in the soil at plinth level and this treatment is called "Pre-construction Anti-termite Treatment". And post construction anti termite treatment when the building structure is ready/existing  and infested with termites, this is done by drilling at the wall and floor junction / skirting level and creating the chemical barrier / zone at the bottom of the walls, this treatment is called "Post-construction Anti-termite Treatment".</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q15_6">6For the under construction buildings, does termite treatment cause any disturbance in the process of construction?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a15_6">6The pre-termite foundation treatment is done simultaneously with your construction work before Plinth PCC (Plain Cement Concrete) and does not affect the process of construction.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q16_6">6For an existing building, does termite treatment cause any damage to the structure?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a16_6">6This treatments causes no damage to the structure. To provide the treatment, the service provider will drill 12 mm dia holes about 300 mm apart at skirting level. After the treatment, these holes will be sealed with white cement and we will try to match the colour of the wall to have minimum decor disturbance.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q17_6">6Do the premises have to be vacated at the time of treatment for existing building (post construction treatment)?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a17_6">6No. You can also see the treatment done. The only precaution is to wear a face mask &amp; to not touch the chemically treated surfaces. Infants, aged persons or any allergic person should not be present at the time of treatment. Post the treatment, you can stay in the premises immediately after cleaning.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q18_6">6Is there any warranty for Post Construction termite treatment?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a18_6">6For the post construction treatment, there is a warranty of 5 years, if done for the entire home / building. In case a specific floor of a building needs to be treated, a 1 year warranty would apply. For the warranty to be valid, the treatment must be completely administered as per the process suggested by our Service Partner. You can get more information from our termite treatment delivery partner after raising a service request.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q19_6">6How much does termite treatment cost? </string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a19_6">6Termite treatment charges can be quoted after the inspection of the site. Charges are dependent on the level of infestation, type of treatment, feasibility of treatment, internal furnitures &amp; fixtures, travel cost and time required for treatment. The service delivery partner will share a detailed estimate of cost post inspection.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q20_6">6How much time does the treatment take?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a20_6">6The treatment takes 1 day of time</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q21_6">6Is the site visit paid or free?</string>

    <string name="pc_faq_q22_6">6What is covered in the termite treatment service?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a22_6">6Sub-terranean termites (ground nesting termites) are only covered in the anti-termite treatment. Since these are the ground nesting termites which grow and travel through the soil, hence the treatment of creating a chemical barrier around the house stops these termites from infesting the house.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q23_6">6What is not covered in the termite treatment service?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a23_6">6Dry-wood termites infestation, which are usually experienced in the coastal regions are not covered under the treatment. Since, these termites are wood nesting termites, they grow inside the wood hence the chemical barrier at foundation level doesn\'t affect them.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q24_6">6For Pre-Construction treatment, do I need to repeat the treatment after the warranty period?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a24_6">6Once the treatment is done, if the created chemical barrier is disturbed somehow, then we need to re-do the treatment and it will charge extra to the customer. Otherwise, the treatment doesn\'t need to be re-done even after the warranty period is over.</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_q25_6">6For post construction treatment, do I need to repeat the treatment after the warranty period?</string>
    <string name="pc_faq_a25_6">6After the expiry of the warranty period, customer needs to re-do the post- construction Anti-termite treatment.</string>

    <string name="vr_faq_q1_6">6What is VR?</string>
    <string name="vr_faq_a1_6">6Virtual Reality (VR) is a service that helps you experience the three dimensional view of your house in an interactive manner. Utec offers the VR service on charge basis. All you have to do is raise a service request with your details, such as plot details and 3D.</string>
    <string name="vr_faq_q2_6">6What does Select a plan for the VR experience mean?</string>
    <string name="vr_faq_a2_6">6You may select one plan out of 3D Elevation views delivered, for the final VR experience.</string>
    <string name="vr_faq_q3_6">6What is the cost of availing the VR Service?</string>
    <string name="vr_faq_a3_6">6The cost of Utec VR Experience depends on the plot context like size of plot, number of floors, etc. After filling in the necessary data, the service cost will be calculated.</string>
    <string name="vr_faq_q4_6">6What does Add to Archivesmean?</string>
    <string name="vr_faq_a4_6">6As a part of Layout Plan service, Utec provides more than one house plan. Please go through the plans and finally select the plan you want to proceed with for either 3D or for making changes. The remaining plans not selected by you, can be accessed through Archives.</string>
    <string name="vr_faq_q5_6">6How can I access my Archives folder later?</string>
    <string name="vr_faq_a5_6">6In order to access your Archives, please go to your service request output from My Projects of Utec app. Click on the Options menu, and then click on Archives to view the archived plans.</string>
    <string name="vr_faq_q6_6">6How can I avail a VR Experience if I choose an existing design on the platform?</string>
    <string name="vr_faq_a6_6">6Please raise a service request for VR walkthrough in the Plans section on Utec App. Mention the design name that you liked along with the mandatory details.

    <string name="vr_faq_a8_6">6Changes in the layout plan post the delivery of a 3D elevation or a VR Experience are not possible. Changes are possible in the 2D and 3D Elevation stage before finalisation of each plan. You may raise a new request for an updated plan along with the required changes.</string>
    <string name="vr_faq_q9_6">6How can I schedule a visit for the VR Experience?</string>
    <string name="vr_faq_a9_6">6You can schedule a VR walkthrough delivery from the available locations with your preferences for date and the time slot.

    <string name="vr_faq_q10_6">6What should I be aware of, before requesting for VR walkthrough service?</string>
